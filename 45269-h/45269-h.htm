<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>The great World War was more than two-thirds
over when America entered the struggle,
and yet in a sense this country was in the war
from its very beginning. Three great inventions
controlled the character of the fighting
and made it different from any other the world
has ever seen. These three inventions were
American. The submarine was our invention;
it carried the war into the sea. The airplane
was an American invention; it carried the war
into the sky. We invented the machine-gun; it
drove the war into the ground.</p>

<p>It is not my purpose to boast of American
genius but, rather, to show that we entered the
war with heavy responsibilities. The inventions
we had given to the world had been developed
marvelously in other lands. Furthermore
they were in the hands of a determined
and unscrupulous foe, and we found before us
the task of overcoming the very machines that
we had created. Yankee ingenuity was faced
with a real test.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
The only way of overcoming the airplane was
to build more and better machines than the enemy
possessed. This we tried to do, but first
we had to be taught by our allies the latest refinements
of this machine, and the war was over
before we had more than started our aërial program.
The machine-gun and its accessory,
barbed wire (also an American invention), were
overcome by the tank; and we may find what
little comfort we can in the fact that its invention
was inspired by the sight of an American
farm tractor. But the tank was a British creation
and was undoubtedly the most important
invention of the war. On the sea we were faced
with a most baffling problem. The U-boat could
not be coped with by the building of swarms of
submarines. The essential here was a means
of locating the enemy and destroying him even
while he lurked under the surface. Two American
inventions, the hydrophone and the depth
bomb, made the lot of the U-boat decidedly unenviable
and they hastened if they did not actually
end German frightfulness on the sea.</p>

<p>But these were by no means the only inventions
of the war. Great Britain showed wonderful
ingenuity and resourcefulness in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
directions; France did marvels with the airplane
and showed great cleverness in her development
of the tank and there was a host of
minor inventions to her credit; while Italy
showed marked skill in the creation of large airplanes
and small seacraft.</p>

<p>The Central Powers, on the other hand, were
less originative but showed marked resourcefulness
in developing the inventions of others.
Forts were made valueless by the large portable
Austrian guns. The long range gun that
shelled Paris was a sensational achievement,
but it cannot be called a great invention because
it was of little military value. The great German
Zeppelins were far from a success because
they depended for their buoyancy on a highly
inflammable gas. It is interesting to note that
while the Germans were acknowledging the failure
of their dirigibles the British were launching
an airship program, and here in America
we had found an economical way of producing a
non-inflammable balloon gas which promises a
great future for aërial navigation.</p>

<p>The most important German contribution to
the war&mdash;it cannot be classed as an invention&mdash;was
poison gas, and it was not long ere they regretted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
this infraction of the rules of civilized
warfare adopted at the Hague Conference; for
the Allies soon gave them a big dose of their
own medicine and before the war was over,
fairly deluged them with lethal gases of every
variety.</p>

<p>Many inventions of our own and of our allies
were not fully developed when the war ended,
and there were some which, although primarily
intended for purposes of war, will be most serviceable
in time of peace. For this war was not
one of mere destruction. It set men to thinking
as they had never thought before. It intensified
their inventive faculties, and as a result, the
world is richer in many ways. Lessons of
thrift and economy have been taught us. Manufacturers
have learned the value of standardization.
The business man has gained an appreciation
of scientific research.</p>

<p>The whole story is too big to be contained
within the covers of a single book, but I have
selected the more important and interesting inventions
and have endeavored to describe them
in simple language for the benefit of the reader
who is not technically trained.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The War in and Under the Ground</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">For</span> years the Germans had been preparing
for war. The whole world knew this,
but it had no idea how elaborate were their
preparations, and how these were carried out
to the very minutest detail. When the call to
arms was sounded, it was a matter of only a
few hours before a vast army had been assembled&mdash;fully
armed, completely equipped, ready
to swarm over the frontiers into Belgium and
thence into France. It took much longer for
the French to raise their armies of defense,
and still longer for the British to furnish
France with any adequate help. Despite the
heroic resistance of Belgium, the Entente Allies
were unprepared to stem the tide of German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
soldiers who poured into the northern part of
France.</p>

<p>So easy did the march to Paris seem, that the
Germans grew careless in their advance and
then suddenly they met with a reverse that sent
them back in full retreat. However, the military
authorities of Germany had studied not
only how to attack but also how to retreat and
how to stand on the defensive. In this, as in
every other phase of the conflict, they were far
in advance of the rest of the world, and after
their defeat in the First Battle of the Marne,
they retired to a strong position and hastily
prepared to stand on the defensive. When
the Allies tried to drive them farther back, they
found that the German army had simply sunk
into the ground. The war of man&oelig;uver had
given way to trench warfare, which lasted
through long, tedious months nearly to the end
of the great conflict.</p>

<p>The Germans found it necessary to make the
stand because the Russians were putting up
such a strong fight on Germany's eastern frontier.
Men had to be withdrawn from the western
front to stem the Russian tide, which meant
that the western armies of the kaiser had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
cease their offensive activities for the time being.
The delay was fatal to the Germans, for
they had opposed to them not only brave men
but intelligent men who were quick to learn.
And when the Germans were ready to resume
operations in the West, they found that the
Allies also had sunk into the ground and had
learned all their tricks of trench warfare, adding
a number of new ones of their own.</p>

<p>The whole character of the war was changed.
The opposing forces were dead-locked and
neither could break through the other's lines.
The idea of digging into the ground did not
originate with this war, but never before had
it been carried out on so extensive a scale.
The inventive faculties of both sides were vainly
exercised to find some way of breaking the
dead-lock. Hundreds of new inventions were
developed. The history of war from the days
of the ancient Romans up to the present time
was searched for some means of breaking down
the opposing lines. However, the dead-lock
was not broken until a special machine had been
invented, a traveling fort. But the story of
that machine is told in another chapter.</p>

<p>At the outset the Allies dug very shallow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
ditches, such as had been used in previous
wars. When it was found that these burrows
would have to be occupied for weeks and months,
the French and British imitated the Germans
and dug their trenches so deep that men could
walk through them freely, without danger of exposing
their heads above ground; and as the
ditches grew deeper, they had to be provided
with a firing-step on which the riflemen could
stand to fire over the top of the trenches. The
trenches were zig-zagged so that they could not
be flanked, otherwise they would have made dangerous
traps for the defenders; for had the
enemy gained one end of the trench, he could
have fired down the full length of it, killing or
wounding every man it contained. But zig-zagging
made it necessary to capture each turn
separately. There were lines upon lines of
these trenches. Ordinarily there were but
three lines, several hundred feet apart, with
communicating trenches connecting them, and
then several <span class="locked">kilometers<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> farther back were reserve
trenches, also connected by communicating
trenches with the front lines.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> A kilometer is, roughly, six tenths of a mile; or six miles
would equal ten kilometers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p></div>

<p>Men did not dare to show themselves out in
the open near the battle-front for a mile or more
behind the front-line trenches, for the enemy's
sharp-shooters were always on the watch for a
target. The men had to stay in the trenches
day and night for two or more weeks at a time,
and sleeping-accommodations of a very rough
sort were provided for them in dugouts which
opened into the trenches. The dugouts of the
Allies were comparatively crude affairs, but the
Germans spent a great deal of time upon their
burrows.</p>

<h3>UNDERGROUND VILLAGES</h3>

<p>When the French first swept the Germans
back out of their trenches along the Aisne, they
were astonished to find how elaborate were these
underground dwellings. They found that the
ground was literally honeycombed with rooms
and passageways. Often the dugouts were
two stories in depth and extended as much as
sixty feet below the level of the ground. In
fact, all along this part of the front, the Germans
had a continuous underground village in
which thousands of men were maintained. The
officers' quarters were particularly well fitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
up, and every attention was given to the comfort
of their occupants. There were steel
door-mats at the entrances of the quarters.
The walls were boarded and even papered.
The bedrooms were fitted with spring beds,
chiffoniers, and wash-stands, and all the rooms
were lighted with electric lamps. There were
spacious quarters for the men, with regular
underground mess halls and elaborate kitchens.
There were power-plants to furnish steam for
the operation of pumps and for the lighting-plants
and for other purposes.</p>

  <div class="caption0">Lines of Zig-Zag Trenches as viewed from an Airplane</div></div>

<p>There was a chalk formation here in which
were many large natural caves. One enormous
cave was said to have held thirty thousand
soldiers, and in this section the Germans kept
large reserve forces. By digging far into the
ground, the German troops secured protection
from shell-fire; in fact, the horrible noise of
battle was heard only as a murmur, down in
these depths. With characteristic thoroughness,
the Germans built their trench system for
a long stay; while the Allies, on the other hand,
looked upon <i>their</i> trenches as merely temporary
quarters, which would hold the enemy at bay
until they could build up armies large enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
to drive the invaders out of the country. The
construction of the trenches along some parts
of the battle-line was particularly difficult, because
of the problem of drainage. This was
especially true in Flanders, where the trenches
in many cases were below water-level, and
elaborate pumping-systems had to be installed
to keep them dry. Some of them were concrete-lined
to make them waterproof. In the early
stages of the war, before the trenches were
drained, the men had to stand in water for a
good part of the time, and the only way they
could get about at all in the miry trenches was
by having "duck-boards" in them. Duck-boards
are sections of wooden sidewalk such as
we find in small villages in this country, consisting
of a couple of rails on which crosspieces
of wood are nailed. These duck-boards fairly
floated in the mud.</p>

<div class="caption0">French Sappers using Stethoscopes to detect the
Mining Operations of the Enemy</div></div>

<p>Some of the trenches were provided with
barbed wire barriers or gates calculated to halt
a raiding-party if it succeeded in getting into
the trench. These gates were swung up out
of the way, but when lowered they were kept
closed with a rather complicated system of bolts
which the enemy would be unable to unfasten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
without some delay; and while he was struggling
to get through the gate, he would be a
target for the bullets of the defenders.</p>

<h3>HIDING RAILROADS IN DITCHES</h3>

<p>Because of the elaborate system of trenches,
and the distance from the front line to that part
of the country where it was safe to operate in
the open, it was necessary to build railways
which would travel through tunnels and communicating
trenches to the front lines. These
were narrow-gage railroads and a special standard
form of track section was designed, which
was entirely of metal, something like the track
sections of toy railroads. The tracks were
very quickly laid and taken up at need. The
locomotives had to be silent and smokeless and
so a special form of gasolene locomotive was
invented to haul the little cars along these miniature
railroads to the front lines. Usually the
trench railroads did not come to the very front
of the battle-line, but their principal use was
to carry shell to the guns which were located
in concealed positions. Railroad or tramway
trenches could not be sharply zig-zagged but had
to have easy curves, which were apt to be recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
by enemy airplanes, and so they were
often concealed under a covering of wire strewn
with leaves.</p>

<h3>PERISCOPES AND "SNIPERSCOPES"</h3>

<p>But while the armies were buried underground,
it was necessary for them to keep their
eyes upon each other so that each might be
ready for any sudden onslaught of the other.
Snipers were always ready to fire at any head
that showed itself above the parapet of the
trench and so the soldiers had to steal an idea
from the submarines and build them periscopes
with which they could look over the top of their
trenches without exposing themselves. A
trench periscope was a very simple affair, consisting
of a tube with two mirrors, one at the
top and one at the bottom, set at such an angle
that a person looking into the side of the tube
at the bottom could see out of the opposite side
of the tube at the top.</p>

<p>Observation posts were established wherever
there was a slight rise in the ground. Sometimes
these posts were placed far in advance of
the trenches and sometimes even behind the
trenches where it was possible to obtain a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
view of the opposing lines. Sometimes a tunnel
would be dug forward, leading to an outlet
close to the enemy's lines, and here an observer
would take his position at night to spy with his
ears upon the activities of the enemy. Observers
who watched the enemy by day would
often not dare to use periscopes, which might
be seen by the enemy and draw a concentrated
fire of rifles and even shell. So that every
manner of concealment was employed to make
the observation posts invisible and to have
them blend with their surroundings. Observers
even wore veils so that the white of their
skin would not betray them.</p>

<div class="captionh0"><span class="smcap">Fig 1.</span> A "sniperscope" with which a sharp&shy;shooter could take
aim without showing his head above the parapet</div></div>

<p>Snipers were equally ingenious in concealing
themselves. They frequently used rifles which
were connected with a dummy butt and had
a periscope sighting-attachment. This attachment
was called a "sniperscope." The rifle-barrel
could be pushed through a loophole in
the parapet and the sniper standing safely below
the parapet could hold the dummy butt to
his shoulder and aim his rifle with perfect accuracy
by means of the periscope. It was next
to impossible to locate a sniper hidden in this
way. One method of doing it was to examine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
rubbish, tin cans, or any object that had been
penetrated by a bullet and note the direction
taken by the bullet. This would give a line
leading toward the source of the shot, and
when a number of such lines were traced, they
would cross at a spot where the sniper or
his gun was stationed, and a few shell would
put the man out of business. Dummy heads
of papier mâché were sometimes stuck above
the parapet to draw the fire of enemy snipers
and the bullet-holes which quickly appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
in them were studied to discover the location
of the snipers.</p>

<p>Sometimes fixed rifles were used. These
were set on stands so that they could be very
accurately trained upon some important enemy
post. Then they could be fired in the dark,
without aiming, to disturb night operations of
the enemy. Often a brace of rifles, as many as
six, would be coupled up to be fired simultaneously,
and by operating a single lever each gun
would throw out the empty cartridge shell and
bring a fresh one into position.</p>

<h3>STEEL BRIER PATCHES</h3>

<p>The most important defense of a trench system
consisted in the barbed wire entanglements
placed before it. Barbed wire, by the way, is
an American invention, but it was originally
intended for the very peaceful purpose for keeping
cattle within bounds. Long ago it was used
in war, but never to the extent to which it was
employed in this world struggle. The entanglements
were usually set up at night and were
merely fences consisting of stout posts driven
into the ground and strung with barbed wire
running in all directions, so as to make an impenetrable
tangle. Where it was possible to
prepare the entanglements without disturbance
and the position was an important one, the mass
of barbed wire often extended for a hundred
yards or more in depth. Just beyond the entanglements
trip-wires were sometimes used.
A trip-wire was a slack wire which was laid on
the ground. Before being laid, the wire was
tightly coiled so that it would not lie flat, but
would catch the feet of raiders and trip them up.
Each side had "gates" in the line through
which this wire could quickly be removed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
let its own raiding-parties through. Sometimes
raiders used tunnels, with outlets beyond
the barbed wire, but they had to cut their
way through the metal brier patches of their
opponents.</p>

<p>Early in the war, various schemes were devised
for destroying the entanglements. There
were bombs in the form of a rod about twelve
feet long, which could be pushed under the wire
and upon exploding would tear it apart. Another
scheme was to fire a projectile formed
like a grapnel. The projectile was attached
to the end of a cable and was fired from a
small gun in the same way that life-lines are
thrown out to wrecks near shore. Then the
cable would be wound up on a winch and the
grapnel hooks would tear the wire from its fastenings.
Such schemes, however, did not prove
very practicable, and it was eventually found
that a much better way of destroying barbed
wire was to bombard it with high-explosive
shell, which would literally blow the wire apart.
But it required a great deal of shelling to destroy
these entanglements, and it was really
not until the tank was invented that such obstructions
could be flattened out so that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
formed no bar to the passage of the soldiers.</p>

<p>The Germans not only used fixed entanglements,
but they had large standard sections
of barbed wire arranged in the form of big
cylindrical frames which would be carried
easily by a couple of men and could be placed
in position at a moment's notice to close a gap
in the line or even to build up new lines of wire
obstruction.</p>

<h3>MINES AND COUNTER-MINES</h3>

<p>In the earlier stages of the war it proved so
impossible to capture a trench when it was well
defended by machine-guns that efforts were
made to blow up the enemy by means of mines.
Tunnels were dug reaching out under the
enemy's lines and large quantities of explosives
were stored in them. At the moment when
it was intended to make an assault, there would
be a heavy cannonading to disconcert the enemy,
and then the mine would be touched off. In
the demoralizing confusion that resulted, the
storming-party would sweep over the enemy.
Such mines were tried on both sides, and the
only protection against them was to out-guess
the other side and build counter-mines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
If it were suspected, from the importance of
a certain position and the nature of the ground,
that the enemy would probably try to undermine
it, the defenders would dig tunnels of their
own toward the enemy at a safe distance beyond
their own lines and establish listeners
there to see if they could hear the mining-operations
of their opponents. Very delicate
microphones were used, which the listeners
would place on the ground or against the walls
of their tunnel. Then they would listen for the
faintest sound of digging, just as a doctor
listens through a stethoscope to the beating
of a patient's heart or the rush of air through
his lungs. When these listening-instruments
picked up the noise of digging, the general direction
of the digging could be followed out by
placing the instrument at different positions
and noting where the noise was loudest. Then
a counter-mine would be extended in that direction,
far enough down to pass under the enemy's
tunnel, and at the right moment, a charge of
TNT (trinitrotoluol) would be exploded, which
would destroy the enemy's sappers and put an
end to their ambitious plans.</p>

<p>A very interesting case of mining was furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
by the British when they blew up the important
post of Messines Ridge. This was
strongly held by the Germans and the only way
of dislodging the enemy was to blow off the top
of the ridge. Before work was started, geologists
were called upon to determine whether
or not the ground were suitable for mining-operations.
They picked out a spot where the
digging was good from the British side, but
where, if counter-mines were attempted from
the German side, quicksands would be encountered
and tunneling of any sort would be difficult.
The British sappers could, therefore, proceed
with comparative safety. The Germans
suspected that something of the sort was being
undertaken, but they found it very difficult to
dig counter-mines. However, one day their
suspicions were confirmed, when the whole top
of the hill was blown off, with a big loss of
German lives. In the assault that followed the
British captured the position and it was annexed
to the British lines.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Hand-Grenades and Trench Mortars</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> primitive times battles were fought hand-to-hand.
The first implements of war were
clubs and spears and battle-axes, all intended
for fighting at close quarters. The bow and arrow
enabled men to fight at a distance, but
shields and armor were so effective a defense
that it was only by hand-to-hand fighting that a
brave enemy could be defeated. Even the invention
of gunpowder did not separate the combatants
permanently, for although it was possible
to hurl missiles at a great distance, cannon
were so slow in their action that the enemy could
rush them between shots. Shoulder firearms
also were comparatively slow in the early days,
and liable to miss fire, and it was not until the
automatic rifle of recent years was fully developed
that soldiers learned to keep their distance.</p>

<p>When the great European war started, military
authorities had come to look upon war at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
close quarters as something relegated to bygone
days. Even the bayonet was beginning
to be thought of little use. Rifles could be
charged and fired so rapidly and machine-guns
could play such a rapid tattoo of bullets, that
it seemed impossible for men to come near
enough for hand-to-hand fighting, except at a
fearful cost of life. In developing the rifle,
every effort was made to increase its range so
that it could be used with accuracy at a distance
of a thousand yards and more. But when the
Germans, after their retreat in the First Battle
of the Marne, dug themselves in behind the
Aisne, and the French and British too found it
necessary to seek shelter from machine-gun and
rifle fire by burrowing into the ground, it became
apparent that while rifles and machine-guns
could drive the fighting into the ground,
they were of little value in continuing the fight
after the opposing sides had buried themselves.
The trenches were carried close to one another,
in some instances being so close that the
soldiers could actually hear the conversation of
their opponents across the intervening gap. Under
such conditions long-distance firearms were
of very little practical value. What was needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
was a short-distance gun which would get down
into the enemy trenches. To be sure, the
trenches could be shelled, but the shelling had to
be conducted from a considerable distance,
where the artillery would be immune to attack,
and it was impossible to give a trench the particular
and individual attention which it would
receive at the hands of men attacking it at
close quarters.</p>

<p>Before we go any farther we must learn the
meaning of the word "trajectory." No bullet
or shell travels in a straight line. As soon as
it leaves the muzzle of the gun, it begins to fall,
and its course through the air is a vertical
curve that brings it eventually down to the
ground. This curve is called the "trajectory."
No gun is pointed directly at a target, but above
it, so as to allow for the pull of gravity. The
faster the bullet travels, the flatter is this curve
or trajectory, because there is less time for it
to fall before it reaches its target. Modern
rifles fire their missiles at so high a speed that
the bullets have a very flat trajectory. But in
trench warfare a flat trajectory was not desired.
What was the use of a missile that traveled
in a nearly straight line, when the object to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
be hit was hiding in the ground? Trench fighting
called for a missile that had a very high trajectory,
so that it would drop right into the
enemy trench.</p>

<h3>HAND-ARTILLERY</h3>

<p>Trench warfare is really a close-quarters
fight of fort against fort, and the soldiers who
manned the forts had to revert to the ancient
methods of fighting an enemy intrenched behind
fortifications. Centuries ago, not long
after the first use of gunpowder in war, small
explosive missiles were invented which could be
thrown by hand. These were originally known
as "flying mortars." The missile was about
the size of an orange or a pomegranate, and it
was filled with powder and slugs. A small fuse,
which was ignited just before the device was
thrown, was timed to explode the missile when
it reached the enemy. Because of its size and
shape, and because the slugs it contained corresponded,
in a manner, to the pulp-covered seeds
with which a pomegranate is filled, the missile
was called a "grenade."</p>

<p>Grenades had fallen out of use in modern warfare,
although they had been revived to a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
extent in the Russo-Japanese war, and had been
used with some success by the Bulgarians and
the Turks in the Balkan wars. And yet they
had not been taken very seriously by the military
powers of Europe, except Germany. Germany
was always on the lookout for any device
that might prove useful in war, and when the
Germans dug themselves in after the First Battle
of the Marne, they had large quantities of
hand-grenades for their men to toss over into
the trenches of the Allies. These missiles
proved very destructive indeed. They took the
place of artillery, and were virtually hand-thrown
shrapnel.</p>

<p>The French and British were entirely unprepared
for this kind of fighting, and they had
hastily to improvise offensive and defensive
weapons for trench warfare. Their hand-grenades
were at first merely tin cans filled
with bits of iron and a high explosive in which
a fuse-cord was inserted. The cord was lighted
by means of a cigarette and then the can with
its spluttering fuse was thrown into the enemy
lines. As time went on and the art of grenade
fighting was learned, the first crude missiles
were greatly improved upon and grenades were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
made in many forms for special service.</p>

<p>There was a difference between grenades
hurled from sheltered positions and those used
in open fighting. When the throwers were
sheltered behind their own breastworks, it mattered
not how powerful was the explosion of the
grenade. We must remember that in "hand-artillery"
the shell is far more powerful in proportion
to the distance it is thrown than the
shell fired from a gun, and many grenades were
so heavily charged with explosives that they
would scatter death and destruction farther
than they could be thrown by hand. The grenadier
who cast one of these grenades had to
duck under cover or hide under the walls of
his trench, else the fragments scattered by the
exploding missile might fly back and injure him.
Some grenades would spread destruction to a
distance of over three hundred feet from the
point of explosion. For close work, grenades
of smaller radius were used. These were employed
to fight off a raiding-party after it had
invaded a trench, and the destructive range of
these grenades was usually about twenty-five
feet.</p>

<p>Hand-grenades came to be used in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
different ways that artillery was used. There
were grenades which were filled with gas, not
only of the suffocating and tear-producing
types, but also of the deadly poisonous variety.
There were incendiary grenades which would
set fire to enemy stores, and smoke grenades
which would produce a dense black screen behind
which operations could be concealed from
the enemy. Grenades were used in the same
way that shrapnel was used to produce a barrage
or curtain of fire, through which the enemy
could not pass without facing almost certain
death. Curtains of fire were used not only for
defensive purposes when the enemy was attacking,
but also to cut off a part of the enemy so
that it could not receive assistance and would
be obliged to surrender. In attacks upon the
enemy lines, grenades were used to throw a
barrage in advance of the attacking soldiers so
as to sweep the ground ahead clear of the
enemy.</p>

<p>The French paid particular attention to the
training of grenadiers. A man had to be a
good, cool-headed pitcher before he could be
classed as a grenadier. He must be able to
throw his grenade with perfect accuracy up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
a distance of seventy yards, and to maintain an
effective barrage. The grenadier carried his
grenades in large pockets attached to his belt,
and he was attended by a carrier who brought
up grenades to him in baskets, so that he was
served with a continuous supply.</p>

<h3>LONG-DISTANCE GRENADE-THROWING</h3>

<div id="ip_28" class="figleft" style="width: 69px;">
  <img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="69" height="477" class="up2" alt="" /><br />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span> A rifle grenade
fitted to the
muzzle of a rifle</p></div></div>

<p>All this relates to short-distance fighting, but
grenades were also used for ranges beyond the
reach of the pitcher's arm. Even back in the
sixteenth century, the range of the human arm
was not great enough to satisfy the combatants
and grenadiers used a throwing-implement,
something like a shovel, with which the grenade
was slung to a greater distance, in much the
same way as a lacrosse ball is thrown. Later,
grenades were fitted with light, flexible wooden
handles and were thrown, handle and all, at the
enemy. By this means they could be slung to
a considerable distance. Such grenades were
used in the recent war, particularly by the Germans.
The handle was provided with streamers
so as to keep the grenade head-on to the enemy,
and it was usually exploded by percussion on
striking its target. These long-handled grenades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
however, were clumsy
and bulky, and the grenadier required
a good deal of elbow-room
when throwing them.</p>

<p>A much better plan was to
hurl them with the aid of a gun.
A rifle made an excellent short-distance
mortar. With it grenades
could be thrown from
three to four hundred yards.
The grenade was fastened on a
rod which was inserted in the
barrel of the rifle and then it was
fired out of the gun by the explosion
of a blank cartridge.
The butt of the rifle was rested
on the ground and the rifle was
tilted so as to throw the grenade
up into the air in the way that
a mortar projects its shell.</p>

<h3>STRIKING A LIGHT</h3>

<p>The lighting of the grenade
fuses with a cigarette did very
well for the early tin-can grenades,
but the cigarettes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
not always handy, particularly in the heat
of battle, and something better had to be devised.
One scheme was to use a safety-match
composition on the end of a fuse. This
was covered with waxed paper to protect
it from the weather. The grenadier wore
an armlet covered with a friction composition
such as is used on a safety-match box.
Before the grenade was thrown, the waxed
paper was stripped off and the fuse was lighted
by being scratched on the armlet. In another
type the fuse was lighted by the twisting of a
cap which scratched a match composition on a
friction surface. A safety-pin kept the cap
from turning until the grenadier was ready to
throw the grenade.</p>

<p>The Mills hand-grenade, which proved to be
the most popular type used by the British Army,
was provided with a lever which was normally
strapped down and held by means of a safety-pin.
<a href="#ip_30">Fig&nbsp;4</a> shows a sectional view of this
grenade. Just before the missile was thrown,
it was seized in the hand so that the lever was
held down. Then the safety-pin was removed
and when the grenade was thrown, the lever
would spring up under pull of the spring <i>A</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
This would cause the pin <i>B</i> to strike the percussion
cap <i>C</i>, which would light the fuse <i>D</i>.
The burning fuse would eventually carry the fire
to the detonator <i>E</i>, which would touch off the
main explosive, shattering the shell of the grenade
and scattering its fragments in all directions.
The shell of the grenade was indented
so that it would break easily into a great many
small pieces.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span> Details of the Mills hand grenade</div></div>

<p>There were some advantages in using grenades
lighted by fuse instead of percussion,
and also there were many disadvantages. If
too long a time-fuse were used, the enemy might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
catch the grenade, as you would a baseball and
hurl it back before it exploded. This was a
hazardous game, but it was often done.</p>

<p>Among the different
types of grenades which
the Germans used was
one provided with a parachute
as shown in <a href="#ip_31">Fig.&nbsp;5</a>.
The object of the parachute
was to keep the
head of the grenade toward
the enemy, so that
when it exploded it would
expend its energies forward
and would not cast
fragments back toward
the man who had thrown
it. This was a very sensitive
grenade, arranged
to be fired by percussion,
but it was so easily exploded
that the firing-mechanism
was not released
until after the
grenade had been thrown.
In the handle of this grenade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
there was a bit of cord about twenty feet
long. One end of this was attached to a safety-needle,
<i>A</i>, while the other end, formed into a
loop, was held by the grenadier when he threw
the grenade. Not until the missile had reached
a height of twelve or thirteen feet would the
pull of the string withdraw the needle <i>A</i>. This
would permit a safety-hook, <i>B</i>, to drop out of
a ring, <i>C</i>, on the end of a striker pellet, <i>D</i>.
When the grenade struck, the pellet <i>D</i> would
move forward and a pin, <i>E</i>, would strike a cap
on the detonator <i>F</i>, exploding the missile. This
form of safety-device was used on a number of
German grenades.</p>

<p>The British had another scheme for locking
the mechanism until after the grenade had
traveled some distance through the air. Details
of this grenade, which was of the type
adopted to be fired from a rifle, are shown in
<a href="#ip_32">Fig.&nbsp;6.</a> The striker <i>A</i> is retained by a couple
of bolts, <i>B</i>, which in turn are held in place by
a sleeve, <i>C</i>. On the sleeve is a set of wind-vanes,
<i>D</i>. As the grenade travels through the
air, the wind-vanes cause the sleeve <i>C</i> to revolve,
screwing it down clear of the bolts <i>B</i>,
which then drop out, permitting the pin <i>A</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
strike the detonator <i>E</i> upon impact of the grenade
with its target.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span> A curious German hand grenade shaped like a hair
brush</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>The Germans had one peculiar type which
was in the shape of a disk. In the disk were
six tubes, four of which carried percussion caps
so that the grenade was sure to explode no matter
on which tube it fell. The disk was thrown
with the edge up, and it would roll through the
air. Another type of grenade was known as
the hair-brush grenade because it had a rectangular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
body of tin about six inches long and two
and three quarter inches wide and deep, which
was nailed to a wooden handle.</p>

<h3>MINIATURE ARTILLERY</h3>

<p>Hand-artillery was very effective as far as
it went, but it had its limitations. Grenades
could not be made heavier than two pounds in
weight if they were to be thrown by hand; in
fact, most of them were much lighter than that.
If they were fired from a rifle, the range was
increased but the missile could not be made very
much heavier. TNT is a very powerful explosive,
but there is not room for much of it
in a grenade the size of a large lemon. Trench
fighting was a duel between forts, and while the
hand-artillery provided a means of attacking
the defenders of a fort, it made no impression on
the walls of the fort. It corresponded to shrapnel
fire on a miniature scale, and something
corresponding to high-explosive fire on a small
scale was necessary if the opposing fortifications
were to be destroyed. To meet this problem,
men cast their thoughts back to the primitive
artillery of the Romans, who used to hurl
great rocks at the enemy with catapults. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
the trench fighters actually rigged up catapults
with which they hurled heavy bombs at the
enemy lines. All sorts of ingenious catapults
were built, some modeled after the old Roman
machines. In some of these stout timbers were
used as springs, in others there were powerful
coil springs. It was not necessary to cast the
bombs far. For distant work the regular artillery
could be used. What was needed was a
short-distance gun for heavy missiles and that
is what the catapult was.</p>

<div class="caption0">Dropping a shell into a 6-inch trench mortar</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>But the work of the catapult was not really
satisfactory. The machine was clumsy; it occupied
too much space, and it could not be aimed
very accurately. It soon gave way to a more
modern apparatus, fashioned after the old
smooth-bore mortars. This was a miniature
mortar, short and wide-mouthed. A rifled barrel
was not required, because, since the missile
was not to be hurled far, it was not necessary to
set it spinning by means of rifling so as to hold
it head-on to the wind.</p>

<h3>GIANT PEA-SHOOTERS</h3>

<p>Better aim was secured when a longer-barreled
trench mortar came to be used. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
trench, weight was an important item. There
was no room in which to handle heavy guns, and
the mortar had to be portable so that it could
be carried forward by the infantry in a charge.
As the walls of a light barrel might be burst
by the shock of exploding powder, compressed
air was used instead. The shell was virtually
blown out of the gun in the same way that a boy
blows missiles out of a pea-shooter. That the
shell might be kept from tumbling, it was fitted
with vanes at the rear. These acted like the
feathers of an arrow to hold the missile head-on
to its course.</p>

<p>The French in particular used this type of
mortar and the air-pump was used to compress
the air that propelled the shell or aërial torpedo,
or else the propelling charge was taken from
a compressed-air tank. Carbon-dioxide, the
gas used in soda-water, is commonly stored in
tanks under high pressure and this gas was
sometimes used in place of compressed air.
When the gas in the tank was exhausted the latter
could be recharged with air by using a hand-pump.
Two or three hundred strokes of the
pump would give a pressure of one hundred and
twenty to one hundred and fifty pounds per inch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
and would supply enough air to discharge a
number of shell. The air was let into the barrel
of the mortar in a single puff sufficient to
launch the shell; then the tank was cut off at
once, so that the air it contained would not
escape and go to waste.</p>

<h3>THE STOKES MORTAR</h3>

<p>However, the most useful trench mortar developed
during the war was invented by Wilfred
Stokes, a British inventor. In this a comparatively
slow-acting powder was used to propel
the missile, and so a thin-walled barrel could
be used. The light Stokes mortar can easily
be carried over the shoulder by one man. It
has two legs and the barrel itself serves as
a third leg, and the mortar stands like a tripod.
The two legs are adjustable, so that the barrel
can be inclined to any desired angle. It took
but a moment to set up the mortar for action in
a trench or shell-hole.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span> A 6-inch trench
  mortar shell fitted with tail-vanes</div></div>

<p>Curiously enough, there is no breech-block,
trigger or fire-hole in this mortar. It is fired
merely by the dropping of the missile into the
mouth of the barrel. The shell carries its own
propelling charge, as shown in <a href="#ip_39">Fig.&nbsp;9.</a> This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
is in the form of rings, <i>A</i>, which are fitted on
a stem, <i>B</i>. At the end of the stem are a detonating
cap and a cartridge, to ignite the
propellant, <i>A</i>. At the bottom of the mortar
barrel, there is a steel point, <i>E</i>, known as the
"anvil." When the shell is dropped into the
mortar, the cap strikes the anvil, exploding the
cartridge and touching off the propelling
charge, <i>A</i>. The gases formed by the burning
charge hurl the shell out of the barrel to a
distance of several hundred yards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
The first Stokes mortar was made to fire a
3-inch shell, but the mortar grew in size until
it could hurl shell of 6-inch
and even 8½-inch
size. Of course, the
larger mortars had to
have a very substantial
base. They were not so
readily portable as the
smaller ones and they
could not be carried by
one man; but compared
with ordinary artillery of
the same bore they were
immeasurably lighter
and could be brought to
advanced positions and
set up in a very short
time. The larger shell
have tail-vanes, as shown
in <a href="#ip_40">Fig.&nbsp;10</a>, to keep them
from tumbling when in flight.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Guns that Fire Themselves</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Many</span> years ago a boy tried his hand at
firing a United States Army service
rifle. It was a heavy rifle of the Civil War
period, and the lad did not know just how to
hold it. He let the butt of the gun rest uncertainly
against him, instead of pressing it
firmly to his shoulder, and, in consequence, when
the gun went off he received a powerful kick.</p>

<p>That kick made a deep impression on the
lad, not only on his flesh but on his mind as
well. It gave him a good conception of the
power of a rifle cartridge.</p>

<p>Years afterward, when he had moved to England,
the memory of that kick was still with
him. It was a useless prank of the gun, he
thought, a waste of good energy. Why could
not the energy be put to use? And so he set
himself the task of harnessing the kick of the
gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
A very busy program he worked out for that
kick to perform. He planned to have the gun
use up its exuberant energy in loading and firing
itself. So he arranged the cartridges on a
belt and fed the belt into the gun. When the
gun was fired, the recoil would unlock the breech,
take out the empty case of the cartridge just
fired, select a fresh cartridge from the belt, and
cock the main spring; then the mechanism would
return, throwing the empty cartridge-case out
of the gun, pushing the new cartridge into the
barrel, closing the breech, and finally pulling
the trigger. All this was to be done by the
energy of a single kick, in about one tenth of a
second, and the gun would keep on repeating the
operation as long as the supply of cartridges
was fed to it. The new gun proved so successful
that the inventor was knighted, and became Sir
Hiram Maxim.</p>

<h3>A DOCTOR'S TEN-BARRELED GUN</h3>

<p>But Maxim's was by no means the first machine-gun.
During the Civil War a Chicago
physician brought out a very ingenious ten-barreled
gun, the barrels of which were fired
one after the other by the turning of a hand-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>crank.
Although Dr. Gatling was a graduate
of a medical school, he was far more fond of
tinkering with machinery than of doling out
pills. He invented a number of clever mechanisms,
but the one that made him really famous
was that machine-gun. At first our government
did not take the invention seriously. The gun
was tried out in the war, but whenever it went
into battle it was fired not by soldiers but by a
representative of Dr. Gatling's company, who
went into the army to demonstrate the worth of
the invention. Not until long after was the
Gatling gun officially adopted by our army.
Then it was taken up by many of the European
armies as well.</p>

<p>Although many other machine-guns were invented,
the Gatling was easily the best and most
serviceable, until the Maxim invention made its
appearance, and even then it held its own for
many years; but eventually it had to succumb.
The Maxim did not have to be cranked: it
fired itself, which was a distinct advantage;
and then, instead of being a bundle of guns
all bound up into a single machine, Maxim's
was a single-barreled gun and hence was much
lighter and could be handled much more easily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<h3>A GUN AS A GAS-ENGINE</h3>

<p>Another big advance was made by a third
American, Mr. John M. Browning, who is responsible
for the Colt gun. It was not a kick
that set Browning to thinking. He looked upon
a gun as an engine of the same order as an
automobile engine, and really the resemblance
is very close. The barrel of the gun is the
cylinder of the engine; the bullet is the piston;
and for fuel gunpowder is used in place of gasolene.
As in the automobile engine, the charge
is fired by a spark; but in the case of the gun
the spark is produced by a blow of the trigger
upon a bit of fulminate of mercury in the end of
the cartridge.</p>

  <div class="captionl">Courtesy of "Scientific American"</div>

<div class="caption0">The Benèt-Mercié Gun operated by gas</div></div>

<p>Explosion is the same thing as burning. The
only way that the explosion of gunpowder differs
from the burning of a stick of wood is that
the latter is very slow, while the former goes
like a flash. In both cases the fuel turns into
great volumes of gas. In the case of the gun
the gas is formed almost instantly and in such
quantity that it has to drive the bullet out of
the barrel to make room for itself. In the cartridge
that our army uses, only about a tenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
of an ounce of smokeless powder is used, but
this builds up so heavy a pressure of gas that
the bullet is sent speeding out of the gun at a
rate of half a mile a second. It travels so fast
that it will plow through four feet of solid wood
before coming to a stop.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="container">

<div class="caption0">Browning Machine-Gun, weighing 34½ pounds</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Now it occurred to Browning that it wouldn't
really be stealing to take a little of that gas-power
and use it to work the mechanism of his
machine-gun. It was ever so little he wanted,
and the bullet would never miss it. The
danger was not that he might take too much.
His problem was to take any power at all without
getting more than his mechanism could
stand. What he did was to bore a hole through
the side of the gun-barrel. When the gun was
fired, nothing happened until the bullet passed
this hole; then some of the gas that was pushing
the bullet before it would blow out through
the hole. But this would be a very small
amount indeed, for the instant that the bullet
passed out of the barrel the gases would rush
out after it, the pressure in the gun would drop,
and the gas would stop blowing through the
hole. With the bullet traveling at the rate of
about half a mile in a second, imagine how short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
a space of time elapses after it passes the hole
before it emerges from the muzzle, and what a
small amount of gas can pass through the hole
in that brief interval!</p>

<p>The gas that Browning got in this way he
led into a second cylinder, fitted with a piston.
This piston was given a shove, and that gave
a lever a kick which set going the mechanism
that extracted the empty cartridge-case, inserted
a fresh cartridge, and fired it.</p>

<h3>GETTING RID OF HEAT</h3>

<p>The resemblance of a machine-gun to a gasolene-engine
can be demonstrated still further.
One of the most important parts of an automobile
engine is the cooling-system. The gasolene
burning in the cylinders would soon make
them red-hot, were not some means provided
to carry off the heat. The same is true of a
machine-gun. In fact, the heat is one of the
biggest problems that has to be dealt with. In
a gasolene-engine the heat is carried off in one
of three ways: (1) by passing water around
the cylinders; (2) by building flanges around
the cylinders to carry the heat off into the air;
and (3) by using a fan to blow cool air against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
the cylinders. All of these schemes are used
in the machine-gun. In Dr. Gatling's gun the
cooling-problem was very simple. As there
were ten barrels, one barrel could be cooling
while the rest were taking their turn in the
firing. In other words, each barrel received
only a tenth of the heat that the whole gun was
producing; and yet Gatling found it advisable
to surround the barrels for about half their
length with a water-jacket.</p>

<p>In the Maxim gun a water-jacket is used that
extends the full length of the barrel, and into
this water-jacket seven and a half pints of water
are poured. Yet in a minute and a half of
steady firing at a moderate rate, or before six
hundred rounds are discharged, the water will
be boiling. After that, with every thousand
rounds of continuous fire a pint and a half of
water will be evaporated. Now the water and
the water-jacket add a great deal of weight to
the gun, and this Browning decided to do away
with in his machine-gun. Instead of water he
used air to carry off the heat. The more surface
the air touches, the more heat will it carry
away; and so the Colt gun was at first made
with a very thick-walled barrel. But later the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Colt was formed with flanges, like the flanges
on a motor-cycle engine, so as to increase the
surface of the barrel. Of course, air-cooling is
not so effective as water-cooling, but it is
claimed for this gun, and for other machine-guns
of the same class, that the barrel is
sufficiently cooled for ordinary service. Although
a machine-gun may be capable of firing
many hundred shots per minute, it is seldom
that such a rate is kept up very long in battle.
Usually, only a few rounds are fired at a time
and then there is a pause, and there is plenty
of time for the barrel to cool. Once in a while,
however, the gun has to be fired continuously
for several minutes, and then the barrel grows
exceedingly hot.</p>

<h3>EFFECT OF OVERHEATING</h3>

<p>But what if the gun-barrel does become hot?
The real trouble is not that the cartridge will
explode prematurely, but that the barrel will
expand as it grows hot, so that the bullet will
fit too loosely in the bore. Inside the barrel
the bore is rifled; that is, there are spiral
grooves in it which give a twist to the bullet
as it passes through, setting it spinning like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
top. The spin of the bullet keeps its nose pointing
forward. If it were not for the rifling, the
bullet would tumble over and over, every which
way, and it could not go very far through the
air, to say nothing of penetrating steel armor.
To gain the spinning-motion the bullet must
fit into the barrel snugly enough to squeeze
into the spiral grooves. Now there is another
American machine-gun known as the Hotchkiss,
which was used to a considerable extent by the
French Army. It is a gas-operated gun, something
like the Colt, and it is air-cooled. It was
found in tests of the Hotchkiss gun that in from
three to four minutes of firing the barrel was
expanded so much that the shots began to be a
little uncertain. In seven minutes of continuous
firing the barrel had grown so large that
the rifling failed to grip the bullet at all. The
gun was no better than an old-fashioned
smooth-bore. The bullets would not travel
more than three hundred yards. It is because
of this danger of overheating that the Colt and
the Hotchkiss guns are always furnished with a
spare barrel. As soon as a barrel gets hot it is
uncoupled and the spare one is inserted in its
place. Our men are trained to change the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
barrel of a colt in the dark in a quarter of a
minute.</p>

<p>But a gun that has to have a spare barrel
and that has to have its barrel changed in the
midst of a hot engagement is not an ideal
weapon, by any means. And this brings us to
still another invention&mdash;that, too, by an American.
Colonel I.&nbsp;N. Lewis, of the United States
Army, conceived of a machine-gun that would be
cooled not by still air but by air in motion. This
would do away with all the bother of water-jackets.
It would keep the gun light so that
it could be operated by one man, and yet it
would not have to be supplied with a spare
barrel.</p>

<p>Like the Colt and the Hotchkiss, the Lewis
gun takes its power from the gas that comes
through a small port in the barrel, near the
muzzle. In the plate facing page <a href="#Page_44">44</a> the port
may be seen leading into a cylinder that lies
under the barrel. It takes about one ten-thousandth
part of a second for a bullet to
pass out of the barrel after clearing the port,
but in that brief interval there is a puff of
gas in the cylinder which drives back a piston.
This piston has teeth on it which engage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
a small gear connected with a main-spring.
When the piston moves back, it winds
the spring, and it is this spring that operates
the mechanism of the gun. The cartridges, instead
of being taken from a belt or a clip, are
taken from a magazine that is round and flat.
There are forty-seven cartridges in the magazine
and they are arranged like the spokes of a
wheel, but in two layers. As soon as forty-seven
rounds have been fired, the shooting must
stop while a new magazine is inserted. But to
insert it takes only a couple of seconds.</p>

<h3>USING THE BULLET TO FAN THE GUN</h3>

<p>The most ingenious part of the Lewis gun
is the cooling-system. On the barrel of the gun
are sixteen flanges or fins. These, instead of
running around the gun, run lengthwise of the
barrel. They are very light fins, being made
of aluminum, and are surrounded by a casing
of the same metal. The casing is open at
each end so that the air can flow through it,
but it extends beyond the muzzle of the barrel,
and there it is narrowed down. At the end of
the barrel there is a mouthpiece so shaped that
the bullet, as it flies through, sucks a lot of air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
in its wake, making a strong current flow
through the sixteen channels formed between
the fins inside the casing. This air flows at the
rate of about seventy miles per hour, which is
enough to carry off all the heat that is generated
by the firing of the cartridges. The gun may
be regulated to fire between 350 and 750 rounds
per minute, and its total weight is only 25½
pounds.</p>

<p>America can justly claim the honor of inventing
and developing the machine-gun, although
Hiram Maxim did give up his American citizenship
and become a British subject. By the way,
he is not to be confused with his younger
brother, Hudson Maxim, the inventor of high
explosives, who has always been an American
to the core. Of course we must not get the impression
that only Americans have invented
machine-guns. There have been inventors of
such weapons in various countries of Europe,
and even in Japan. Our own army for a while
used a gun known as the Benèt-Mercié, which
is something like the Hotchkiss. This was invented
by L.&nbsp;V. Benèt, an American, and H.&nbsp;A.
Mercié, a Frenchman, both living in St. Denis,
France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<h3>THE BROWNING MACHINE-GUN</h3>

<p>When we entered the war, it was expected
that we would immediately equip our forces
with the Lewis gun, because the British and the
Belgians had found it an excellent weapon and
also because it was invented by an American
officer, who very patriotically offered it to our
government without charging patent royalties.
But the army officials would not accept it,
although many Lewis guns were bought by the
navy. This raised a storm of protest throughout
the country until finally it was learned that
there was another gun for which the army was
waiting, which it was said would be the very
best yet. The public was skeptical and finally
a test was arranged in Washington at which the
worth of the new gun was demonstrated.</p>

<div id="ip_53" class="figcenter" style="width: 548px;">
  <img src="images/i_053.jpg" width="548" height="288" alt="" /><br />
  <div class="captionl">Courtesy of "Scientific American"</div>

<div class="caption0">An elaborate German Machine-Gun Fort</div></div>

<p>It was a new Browning model; or, rather,
there were two distinct models. One of them,
known as the heavy model, weighed only 34½
pounds, this with its water-jacket filled; for it
was a water-cooled gun. Without its charge of
water the machine weighed but 22½ pounds and
could be rated as a very light machine-gun.
However, it was classed as a heavy gun and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
operated from a tripod. The new machine used
recoil to operate its mechanism. The construction
was simple, there were few parts, and the
gun could very quickly be taken apart in case
of breakage or disarrangement of the mechanism.
But the greatest care was exercised to
prevent jamming of cartridges, which was one
of the principal defects in the other types of
machine-guns. In the test this new weapon
fired twenty thousand shots at the rate of six
hundred per minute, with interruptions of only
four and a half seconds, due partly to defective
cartridges.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that the new Browning
was a remarkable weapon. But if that could
be said of the heavy gun, the light gun was a
marvel. It weighed only fifteen pounds and
was light enough to be fired from the shoulder
or from the hip, while the operator was walking
or running. In fact, it was really a machine-rifle.
The regular .30-caliber service
cartridges were used, and these were stored in
a clip holding twenty cartridges. The cartridges
could be fired one at a time, or the entire
clip could be fired in two and a half seconds. It
took but a second to drop an empty clip out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
the gun and replace it with a fresh one. The
rifle was gas-operated and air-cooled, but no
special cooling-device was supplied because it
would seldom be necessary to fire a shoulder
rifle fast enough and long enough for the barrel
to become overheated.</p>

<p>After the Browning machine-rifle was demonstrated
it was realized that the army had been
perfectly justified in waiting for the new
weapon. Like the heavy Browning, the new
rifle was a very simple mechanism, with few
parts which needed no special tools to take them
apart or reassemble them; a single small wrench
served this purpose. Both the heavy and the
light gun were proof against mud, sand, and
dust of the battle-field. But best of all, a man
did not have to have highly specialized training
before he could use the Browning rifle. It did
not require a crew to operate one of these guns.
Each soldier could have his own machine-gun
and carry it in a charge as he would a rifle.
The advantage of the machine-rifle was that the
operator could fire as he ran, watching where
the bullets struck the ground by noting the dust
they kicked up and in that way correcting his
aim until he was on the target. Very accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
shooting was thus made possible, and the machine-rifle
proved invaluable in the closing
months of the war.</p>

<p>Browning is unquestionably the foremost inventor
of firearms in the world. He was born
of Mormon parents, in Ogden, Utah, in 1854,
and his father had a gun shop. As a boy
Browning became familiar with the use of firearms
and when he was but fourteen years of
age he invented an improved breech mechanism
which was later used in the Winchester repeater.
Curiously enough, it was a Browning pistol that
was used by the assassin at Serajevo who killed
the Archduke of Austria and precipitated the
great European war, and it was with the Browning
machine-gun and rifle that our boys swept
the Germans back through the Argonne Forest
and helped to bring the war to a successful
end.</p>

<h3>THE MACHINE-GUN IN SERVICE</h3>

<p>Although the machine-gun has been used ever
since the Civil War, it was not a vital factor in
warfare until the recent great conflict. Army
officials were very slow to take it up, because
they did not understand it. They used to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
of it as an inferior piece of light artillery, instead
of a superior rifle. The Gatling was so
heavy that it had to be mounted on wheels, and
naturally it was thought of as a cannon. In
the Franco-Prussian War the French had a machine-gun
by which they set great store. It was
called a <i>mitrailleuse</i>, or a gun for firing grape-shot.
It was something like the Gatling. The
French counted on this machine to surprise
and overwhelm the Germans. But they made
the mistake of considering it a piece of artillery
and fired it from long range, so that it did
not have a chance to show its worth. Only on
one or two occasions was it used at close
range, and then it did frightful execution.
However, it was a very unsatisfactory machine,
and kept getting out of order. It earned the
contempt of the Germans, and later when the
Maxim gun was offered to the German Army
they would have none of it. They did not want
to bother with "a toy cannon."</p>

<p>It really was not until the war between Russia
and Japan that military men began to realize
the value of the machine-gun. As the war
went on, both the Russians and the Japanese
bought up all the machine-guns they could secure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
They learned what could be done with
the aid of barbed wire to retard the enemy while
the machine-guns mowed them down as they
were trying to get through.</p>

<p>A man with a machine-gun is worth a hundred
men with rifles; such is the military estimate
of the weapon. The gun fires so fast that
after hitting a man it will hit him again ten
times while he is falling to the ground. And
so it does not pay to fire the gun continuously
in one direction, unless there is a dense mass of
troops charging upon it. Usually the machine-gun
is swept from side to side so as to cover
as wide a range as possible. It is played upon
the enemy as you would play the hose upon the
lawn, scattering a shower of lead among the
advancing hosts.</p>

<h3>MACHINE-GUN FORTS</h3>

<p>It used to be thought that the Belgian forts of
armored steel and concrete, almost completely
buried in the ground, would hold out against
any artillery. But when the Germans brought
up their great howitzers and hurled undreamed-of
quantities of high explosives on
these forts, they broke and crumbled to pieces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Then it was predicted that the day of the fort
was over. But the machine-gun developed a
new type of warfare. Instead of great forts,
mounting huge guns, little machine-gun forts
were built, and, they were far more troublesome
than the big fellows.</p>

<p>To the Germans belongs the credit for the new
type of fort, which consisted of a small concrete
structure, hidden from view as far as possible,
but commanding some important part of the
front. "Pill-boxes," the British call them, because
the first ones they ran across were round
in shape and something like a pill-box in appearance.
These pill-boxes were just large
enough to house a few men and a couple of
machine-guns. Concealment was of the utmost
importance; safety depended upon it. Airplanes
were particularly feared, because a machine-gun
emplacement was recognized to be
so important that a whole battery of artillery
would be turned upon a suspected pill-box.</p>

<p>Some of the German machine-gun forts were
very elaborate, consisting of spacious underground
chambers where a large garrison of
gunners could live. These forts were known
as <i>Mebus</i>, a word made from the initials of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
"<i>Maschinengewehr Eisen-Bettungs Unterstand</i>,"
meaning a machine-gun iron-bedded
foundation.</p>

<p>It was the machine-gun that was responsible
for the enormous expenditure of ammunition in
the war. Before a body of troops dared to
make a charge, the ground had to be thoroughly
searched by the big guns for any machine-gun
nests. Unless these were found and destroyed
by shell-fire, the only way that remained to get
the best of them was to crush them down with
tanks. It was really the machine-gun that
drove the armies into trenches and under the
ground.</p>

  <div class="caption">Comparative diagram of the path of a projectile from the German Super-gun</div></div>

<p>But a machine-gun did not have to be housed
in a fort, particularly a light gun of the Lewis
type. To be sure, the Lewis gun is a little
heavy to be used as a rifle, but it could easily
be managed with a rest for the muzzle in the
crotch of a tree, and a strong man could actually
fire the piece from the shoulder. The light machine-gun
could go right along with a charging
body of troops and do very efficient service, particularly
in fighting in a town or village, but it
had to be kept moving or it would be a target
for the artillery. In a certain village fight a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
machine-gunner kept changing his position.
He would fire for a few minutes from one building
and then shift over to some other. He did
this no less than six times, never staying more
than five minutes at a time in the same spot.
But each one of the houses was shelled within
fifteen minutes of the time he opened fire from
it, which shows the importance that the Germans
attached to machine-gun fire.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Guns and Super-Guns</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">When</span> the news came that big shells were
dropping into Paris from a gun which
must be at least seventy miles away, the world
at first refused to believe; then it imagined
that some brand-new form of gun or shell
or powder had been invented by the Germans.
However, while the public marveled, ordnance
experts were interested but not astonished.
They knew that it was perfectly feasible to build
a gun that would hurl a shell fifty, or seventy-five,
or even a hundred miles, without involving
anything new in the science of gunnery.</p>

<h3>SHOOTING AROUND THE EDGE OF THE EARTH</h3>

<p>But if such ranges were known to be possible,
why was no such long-distance gun built before?
Simply because none but the Germans would
ever think of shooting around the edge of the
earth at a target so far away that it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
have to be as big as a whole city to be hit at
all. In a distance of seventy miles, the curve
of the earth is considerable. Paris is far below
the horizon of a man standing at St. Gobain,
where the big German gun was located.
And if a hole were bored from St. Gobain
straight to Paris, so that you could see the city
from the gun, it would pass, midway of its
course, three thousand, seven hundred and fifty
feet below the surface of the earth. With the
target so far off, it was impossible to aim at any
particular fort, ammunition depot, or other
point of military importance. There is always
some uncertainty as to just where a shell will
fall, due to slight differences in quality and
quantity of the powder used, in the density of
the air, the direction of the wind, etc. This
variation is bad enough when a shell is to be
fired ten miles, but when the missile has to
travel seventy miles, it is out of the question
to try to hit a target that is not miles in extent.</p>

<p>Twenty years before the war our Ordnance
Department had designed a fifty-mile gun, but
it was not built, because we could see no possible
use for it. Our big guns were built for fighting
naval battles or for the defense of our coasts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
from naval attacks, and there is certainly no use
in firing at a ship that is so far below the horizon
that we cannot even see the tips of its masts;
and so our big guns, though they were capable
of firing a shell twenty-seven miles, if aimed
high enough, were usually mounted in carriages
that would not let them shoot more than twelve
or fifteen miles.</p>

<p>The distance to which a shell can be hurled
depends to a large extent upon the angle of the
gun. If the gun is tilted up to an angle of 15
degrees, the shell will go only about half as
far as if it were tilted up to 43½ degrees, which
is the angle that will carry a shell to its greatest
distance. If the long-range German gun
was fired at that angle, the shell must have
risen to a height of about twenty-four miles.</p>

<h3>BEYOND THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE</h3>

<p>Most of the air that surrounds our globe lies
within four miles of the surface. Few airplanes
can rise to a greater height than this, because
the air is so thin that it gives no support to the
wings of the machine. The greatest height to
which a man has ever ascended is seven miles.
A balloon once carried two men to such a height.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
One of them lost consciousness, and the other,
who was nearly paralyzed, succeeded in pulling
the safety-valve rope, with his teeth. That
brought the balloon down, and their instruments
showed that they had gone up thirty-six thousand
feet. What the ocean of air contains above
that elevation, we do not know, but judging by
the way the atmosphere thins out as we rise
from the surface of the earth, we reckon that
nine tenths of the air lies within ten miles of
the surface of the earth. At twenty-four miles,
or the top of the curve described by the shell
of the German long-range guns, there must be
an almost complete vacuum.</p>

<p>If only we could accompany a shell on its
course, we should find a strange condition of
affairs. The higher we rose, the darker would
the heavens become, until the sun would shine
like a fiery ball in a black sky. All around, the
stars would twinkle, and below would be the
glare of light reflected from the earth's surface
and its atmosphere, while the cold would be far
more intense than anything suffered on earth.
Up at that height, there would be nothing to indicate
that the shell was moving&mdash;no rush of
air against the ears. We should seem detached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
from earth and out in the endless reaches of
space.</p>

<p>It seems absurd to think that a shell weighing
close to a quarter of a ton could be retarded
appreciably by mere air. But when we realize
that the shell left the gun at the rate of over
half a mile a second&mdash;traveling about thirty
times faster than an express-train&mdash;we know
that the air-pressure mounts up to a respectable
figure. The pressure is the same whether a
shell is moving through the air or the air is
blowing against the shell. When the wind
blows at the rate of 100 to 120 miles per hour,
it is strong enough to lift houses off their foundations,
to wrench trees out of the ground, to
pick up cattle and carry them sailing through
the air. Imagine what it would do if its velocity
were increased to 1,800 miles per hour.
That is what the shell of a big gun has to contend
with. As most of the air lies near the
earth, the shell of long-range guns meet with
less and less resistance the higher they rise,
until they get up into such thin air that there
is virtually no obstruction. The main trouble
is to pierce the blanket of heavy air that lies
near the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<h3>WAYS OF INCREASING THE RANGE</h3>

<p>The big 16-inch guns that protect our coasts
fire a shell that weighs 2,400 pounds. Nine
hundred pounds of smokeless powder is used to
propel the shell, which leaves the muzzle of the
gun with a speed of 2,600 feet per second. Now,
the larger the diameter of the shell, the greater
will be its speed at the muzzle of the gun, because
there will be a greater surface for the
powder gases to press against. On the other
hand, the larger the shell, the more will it be
retarded by the air, because there will be a
larger surface for the air to press against. It
has been proposed by some ordnance experts
that a shell might be provided with a disk at
each end, which would make it fit a gun of larger
caliber. A 10-inch shell, for instance, could
then be fired from a 16-inch gun. Being lighter
than the 16-inch shell, it would leave the muzzle
of the gun at a higher speed. The disks could
be so arranged that as soon as the shell left
the gun they would be thrown off, and then the
10-inch shell, although starting with a higher
velocity than a 16-inch shell, would offer less
resistance to the air. In that way it could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
made to cover a much greater range. By the
way, the shell of the German long-range gun
was of but 8.2-inch caliber.</p>

<p>Another way of increasing the range is to
lengthen the gun. Right here we must become
acquainted with the word "caliber." Caliber
means the diameter of the shell. A 16-inch gun,
for instance, fires a shell of 16-inch caliber; but
when we read that the gun is a 40-or 50-caliber
gun, it means that the length of the gun is forty
or fifty times the diameter of the shell. Our
biggest coast-defense guns are 50-caliber 16-inch
guns, which means that they are fifty times
16 inches long, or 66-2/3 feet in length. When a
gun is as long as that, care has to be taken to
prevent it from sagging at the muzzle of its own
weight. These guns actually do sag a little,
and when the shell is fired through the long
barrel it straightens up the gun, making the
muzzle "whip" upward, just as a drooping
garden hose does when the water shoots through
it.</p>

  <div class="captionl">Courtesy of "Scientific American"</div>

<div class="caption0">The 121-Mile Gun designed by American Ordnance Officers</div></div>

<p>Now the longer the caliber length of a gun,
the farther it will send a shell, because the powder
gases will have a longer time to push the
shell. But we cannot lengthen our big guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
much more without using some special support
for the muzzle end of the gun, to keep it from
"whipping" too much. It is likely that the
long-range German gun was provided with a
substantial support at the muzzle to keep it
from sagging.</p>

<div class="caption0">American 16-Inch Rifle on a Railway Mount</div></div>

<p>Every once in a while a man comes forth with
a "new idea" for increasing the range. One
plan is to increase the powder-pressure. We
have powders that will produce far more pressure
than an ordinary gun can stand. But we
have to use powders that will burn comparatively
slowly. We do not want too sudden a
shock to start with, but we wish the powder
to give off an enormous quantity of gas which
will keep on pushing and speeding up the shell
until the latter emerges from the muzzle. The
fifty-mile gun that was proposed twenty years
ago was designed to stand a much higher pressure
than is commonly used, and it would have
fired a 10-inch shell weighing 600 pounds with
a velocity of 4,000 feet per second at the muzzle.</p>

<p>The Allies built no "super-guns," because
they knew that they could drop a far greater
quantity of explosives with much greater accuracy
from airplanes, and at a much lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
cost. The German gun at St. Gobain was spectacular
and it did some damage, but it had no
military value and it did not intimidate the
French as the Germans had hoped it would.</p>

<h3>A GUN WITH A RANGE OF A HUNDRED AND
TWENTY MILES</h3>

<p>But although we built no such gun, after the
Germans began shelling Paris our Ordnance
Department designed a gun that would fire a
shell to a distance of over 120 miles! There
was no intention of constructing the gun, but
the design was worked out just as if it were
actually to be built. It was to fire a shell of
10-inch caliber, weighing 400 pounds. Now, an
Elswick standard 10-inch gun is 42 feet long
and its shell weighs 500 pounds. Two hundred
pounds of powder are used to propel the shell,
which leaves the muzzle with a velocity of 3,000
feet per second. If the gun is elevated to the
proper angle, it will send the shell 25 miles, and
it will take the shell a minute and thirty-seven
seconds to cover that distance. But the long-range
gun our ordnance experts designed would
have to be charged with 1,440 pounds of powder
and the shell would leave the muzzle of the gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
with a velocity of 8,500 feet per second. It
would be in the air four minutes and nine seconds
and would travel 121.3 miles. Were the
gun fired from the Aberdeen Proving Grounds,
near Baltimore, Maryland, its shell would travel
across three states and fall into New York Bay
at Perth Amboy. At the top of its trajectory
it would rise 46 miles above the earth.</p>

<p>But the most astonishing part of the design
was the length of the gun, which worked out to
225 feet. An enormous powder-chamber would
have to be used, so that the powder gases would
keep speeding up the shell until it reached the
required velocity at the muzzle. The weight
of the barrel alone was estimated at 325 tons.</p>

<p>It would have to be built up in four sections
screwed together and because of its great
length and weight it would have to be supported
on a steel truss. The gun would be mounted
like a roller lift-bridge with a heavy counter-weight
at its lower end so that it could be elevated
or depressed at will and a powerful hydraulic
jack would be required to raise it.</p>

<p>The recoil of a big gun is always a most important
matter. Unless a gun can recoil, it
will be smashed by the shock of the powder explosion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Usually, heavy springs are used to
take up the shock, or cylinders filled with oil in
which pistons slide. The pistons have small
holes in them through which the oil is forced
as the piston moves and this retards the gun
in its recoil. But this "super-gun" was designed
to be mounted on a carriage running
on a set of tracks laid in a long concrete pit.
On the recoil the gun would run back along
the tracks, and its motion would be retarded by
friction blocks between the carriage and the
tracks and also by a steel cable attached to the
forward end of the carriage and running over
a pulley on the front wall of the pit, to a friction
drum.</p>

<p>The engraving facing page <a href="#Page_68">68</a> gives some idea
of the enormous size of the gun. Note the man
at the breech of the gun. The hydraulic jack
is collapsible, so that the gun may be brought
to the horizontal position for loading, as shown
by the dotted lines. The cost of building this
gun is estimated at two and a half million dollars
and its 400-pound shell would land only
about sixty pounds of high explosives on the
target. A bombing-plane costing but thirty
thousand dollars could land twenty-five times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
as big a charge of high explosives with far
greater accuracy. Aside from this, the gun
lining would soon wear out because of the tremendous
erosion of the powder gases.</p>

<h3>THE THREE-SECOND LIFE OF A GUN</h3>

<p>Powder gases are very hot indeed&mdash;hot
enough to melt steel. The greater the pressure
in the gun, the hotter they are. It is only because
they pass through the gun so quickly,
that they do not melt it. As a matter of fact,
they do wear it out rapidly because of their
heat and velocity. They say that the life of a
big gun is only three seconds. Of course, a shell
passes through the gun in a very minute part
of a second, but if we add up these tiny periods
until we have a total of three seconds, during
which the gun may have fired two hundred
rounds, we shall find that the lining of the barrel
is so badly eroded that the gun is unfit for accurate
shooting, and it must go back to the shops
for a new inner tube.</p>

<h3>ELASTIC GUNS</h3>

<p>We had better go back with it and learn
something about the manufacture of a big gun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Guns used to be cast as a solid chunk of metal.
Now they are built up in layers. To understand
why this is necessary, we must realize
that steel is not a dead mass, but is highly elastic&mdash;far
more elastic than rubber, although, of
course, it does not stretch nor compress so far.
When a charge of powder is exploded in the
barrel of a gun, it expands in all directions.
Of course, the projectile yields to the pressure
of the powder gases and is sent kiting out of the
muzzle of the gun. But for an instant before
the shell starts to move, an enormous force is
exerted against the walls of the bore of the
gun, and, because steel is elastic, the barrel is
expanded by this pressure, and the bore is actually
made larger for a moment, only to spring
back in the next instant. You can picture this
action if you imagine a gun made of rubber;
as soon as the powder was fired, the rubber
gun would bulge out around the powder-chamber,
only to collapse to its normal size when
the pressure was relieved by the discharge of
the bullet.</p>

<p>Now, every elastic body has what is called its
elastic limit. If you take a coil spring, you can
pull it out or you can compress it, and it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
always return to its original shape, unless you
pull it out or compress it beyond a certain
point; that point is its elastic limit. The same
is true of a piece of steel: if you stretch it beyond
a certain point, it will not return to its
original shape. When the charge of powder
in a cannon exceeds a certain amount, it
stretches the steel beyond its elastic limit, so
that the bore becomes permanently larger.
Making the walls of the gun heavier would not
prevent this, because steel is so elastic that the
inside of the walls expands beyond its elastic
limit before the outside is affected at all.</p>

<p>Years ago an American inventor named
Treadwell worked out a scheme for allowing the
bore to expand more without exceeding its elastic
limit. He built up his gun in layers, and
shrunk the outer layers upon the inner layers,
just as a blacksmith shrinks a tire on a wheel,
so that the inner tube of the gun would be
squeezed, or compressed. When the powder
was fired, this inner layer could expand farther
without danger, because it was compressed to
start with. The built-up gun was also independently
invented by a British inventor. All
modern big guns are built up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<h3>HOW BIG GUNS ARE MADE</h3>

<p>The inside tube, known as the lining, is cast
roughly to shape, then it is bored out, after
which it is forged by the blows of a powerful
steam-hammer. Of course, while under the
hammer, the tube is mounted on a mandrel, or
bar, that just fits the bore. The metal is then
softened in an annealing furnace, after which
it is turned down to the proper diameter and re-bored
to the exact caliber. The diameter of
the lining is made three ten-thousandths of an
inch larger than the inside of the hoop or sleeve
that fits over it. This sleeve, which is formed
in the same way, is heated up to 800 degrees,
or until its inside diameter is eight tenths of an
inch larger than the outside diameter of the
lining. The lining is stood up on end and the
sleeve is fitted over it. Then it is cooled by
means of water, so that it grips the lining and
compresses it. In this way, layer after layer
is added until the gun is built up to the proper
size.</p>

  <div class="captionl">Photograph from Underwood &amp; Underwood</div>

<div class="caption0">A Long-distance Sub-calibered French Gun on a Railway Mount</div></div>

<p>Instead of having a lining that is compressed
by means of sleeves or jackets, many big guns
are wound with wire which is pulled so tight as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
to compress the lining. The gun-tube is placed
in a lathe, and is turned so as to wind up the wire
upon it. A heavy brake on the wire keeps it
drawn very tight. This wire, also, is put on in
layers, so that each layer can expand considerably
without exceeding its elastic limit. Our
big 16-inch coast-defense guns are wound with
wire that is one tenth of an inch square. The
length of wire on one gun is sufficient to reach
all the way from New York to Boston with fifty
or sixty miles of wire left over.</p>

<h3>GUNS THAT PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK</h3>

<p>A very ingenious invention is the disappearing-mount
which is used on our coast fortifications.
By means of this a gun is hidden beyond
its breastworks so that it is absolutely invisible
to the enemy. In this sheltered position it is
loaded and aimed. It is not necessary to sight
the gun on the target as you would sight a rifle.
The aiming is done mathematically. Off at
some convenient observation post, an observer
gets the range of the target and telephones this
range to the plotting-room, where a rapid calculation
is made as to how much the gun should
be elevated and swung to the right or the left.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
This calculation is then sent on to the gunners,
who adjust the gun accordingly. When all is
ready, the gun is raised by hydraulic pressure,
and just as it rises above the parapet it is automatically
fired. The recoil throws the gun back
to its crouching position behind the breastworks.
All that the enemy sees, if anything, is the flash
of the discharge.</p>

<p>Now that airplanes have been invented, the
disappearing-mount has lost much of its usefulness.
Big guns have to be hidden from above.
They are usually located behind a hill, five or six
miles back of the trenches, where the enemy cannot
see them from the ground, and they are carefully
hidden under trees or a canopy of foliage
or are disguised with paint.</p>

<p>The huge guns recently built to defend our
coasts are intended to fire a shell that will pierce
the heavy armor of a modern dreadnought.
The shell is arranged to explode after it has
penetrated the armor, and the penetrating-power
is a very important matter. About
thirty years ago the British built three battle-ships,
each fitted with two guns of 16¼-inch caliber
and 30-caliber length. In order to test the
penetrating-power of this gun a target was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
built, consisting first of twenty inches of steel
armor and eight inches of wrought-iron; this
was backed by twenty feet of oak, five feet of
granite, eleven feet of concrete, and six feet
of brick. When the shell struck this target it
passed through the steel, the iron, the oak, the
granite, and the concrete, and did not stop until
it had penetrated three feet of the brick. We
have not subjected our 16-inch gun to such a
test, but we know that it would go through two
such targets and still have plenty of energy left.
Incidentally, it costs us $1,680 each time the big
gun is fired.</p>

<h3>THE FAMOUS FORTY-TWO-CENTIMETER GUN</h3>

<p>One of the early surprises of the war was the
huge gun used by the Germans to destroy the
powerful Belgian forts. Properly speaking,
this was not a gun, but a howitzer; and right
here we must learn the difference between mortars,
howitzers, and guns. What we usually
mean by "gun" is a piece of long caliber which
is designed to hurl its shell with a flat trajectory.
But long ago it was found advantageous
to throw a projectile not at but upon a fortification,
and for this purpose short pieces of large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
bore were built. These would fire at a high
angle, so that the projectile would fall almost
vertically on the target.</p>

<p>As we have said, the bore of a gun is rifled;
that is, it is provided with spiral grooves that
will set the shell spinning, so as to keep its
nose pointing in the direction of its flight.
Mortars, on the other hand, were originally intended
for short-range firing, and their bore
was not rifled. In recent years, however, mortars
have been made longer and with rifled
bores, so as to increase their range, and such
long mortars are called "howitzers." The German
42-centimeter howitzer fired a shell that was
2,108 pounds in weight and was about 1½ yards
long. The diameter of the shell was 42 centimeters,
which is about 16½ inches. It carried
an enormous amount of high explosive, which
was designed to go off after the shell had
penetrated its target. The marvel of this howitzer
was not that it could fire so big a shell but
that so large a piece of artillery could be transported
over the highroads and be set for use in
battle. But although the 42-centimeter gun was
widely advertised, the real work of smashing
the Belgian forts was done by the Austrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
"Skoda" howitzers, which fired a shell of 30.5-centimeter
(12-inch) caliber, and not by the 42-centimeter
gun. The Skoda howitzer could be
taken apart and transported by three motor-cars
of 100 horse-power each. The cars traveled
at a rate of about twelve miles per hour.
It is claimed the gun could be put together in
twenty-four minutes, and would fire at the rate
of one shot per minute.</p>

<h3>FIELD-GUNS</h3>

<p>So far, we have talked only of the big guns,
but in a modern battle the field-gun plays a very
important part. This fires a shell that weighs
between fourteen and eighteen pounds and is
about three inches in diameter. The shell and
the powder that fires it are contained in a cartridge
that is just like the cartridge of a shoulder
rifle. These field-pieces are built to be fired
rapidly. The French 75-millimeter gun, which
is considered one of the best, will fire at the
rate of twenty shots per minute, and its effective
range is considerably over three miles. The
French supplied us with all 75-millimeter guns
we needed in the war, while we concentrated
our efforts on the manufacture of ammunition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<h3>GUNS THAT FIRE GUNS</h3>

<p>During the War of the Revolution, cannon
were fired at short range, and it was the custom
to load them with grape-shot, or small iron
balls, when firing against a charging enemy, because
the grape would scatter like the shot of
a shot-gun and tear a bigger gap in the ranks of
the enemy than would a single solid cannon-ball.
In modern warfare, guns are fired from a
greater distance, so that there will be little danger
of their capture. It is impossible for them
to fire grape, because the ranges are far too
great; besides, it would be impossible to aim a
charge of grape-shot over any considerable distance,
because the shot would start spreading as
soon as they left the muzzle of the gun and
would scatter too far and wide to be of much
service. But this difficulty has been overcome
by the making of a shell which is really a gun in
itself. Within this shell is the grape-shot,
which consists of two hundred and fifty half-inch
balls of lead. The shell is fired over the
lines of the enemy, and just at the right moment
it explodes and scatters a hail of leaden balls
over a fairly wide area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
It is not a simple matter to time a shrapnel
shell so that it will explode at just the right moment.
Spring-driven clockwork has been tried,
which would explode a cap after the lapse of a
certain amount of time; but this way of timing
shells has not proved satisfactory. Nowadays
a train of gunpowder is used. When the shell
is fired, the shock makes a cap (see drawing facing
page <a href="#Page_77">77</a>) strike a pin, <i>E</i>, which ignites the
train of powder, <i>A</i>. The head of the shell is
made of two parts, in each of which there is a
powder-fuse. There is a vent, or short cut,
leading from one fuse to the other, and, by the
turning of one part of the fuse-head with respect
to the other, this short cut is made to carry the
train of fire from the upper to the lower fuse
sooner or later, according to the adjustment.
The fire burns along one powder-train <i>A</i>, and
then jumps through the short cut <i>B</i> to the other,
or movable train, as it is called, until it finally
reaches, through hole <i>C</i>, the main charge <i>F</i>, in
the shell. The movable part of the fuse-head is
graduated so that the fuse may be set to explode
the shell at any desired distance. In the fuse-head
there is also a detonating-pin <i>K</i>, which
will strike the primer <i>L</i> and explode the shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
when the latter strikes the ground, if the time-fuse
has failed to act.</p>

<p>When attacking airplanes, it is important to
be able to follow the flight of the shell, so some
shrapnel shell are provided with a smoke-producing
mixture, which is set on fire when the
shell is discharged, so as to produce a trail of
smoke.</p>

<div class="caption0">Putting on the Gas Masks to Meet a Gas Cloud Attack</div></div>

<p>In meeting the attack of any enemy at night,
search-light shell are sometimes used. On exploding
they discharge a number of "candles,"
each provided with a tiny parachute that lets
the candle drop slowly to the ground. Their
brilliant light lasts fifteen or twenty minutes.
Obviously, ordinary search-lights could not be
used on the battle-field, because the lamp would
at once be a target for enemy batteries, but with
search-light shell the gun that fires them can
remain hidden and one's own lines be shrouded
in darkness while the enemy lines are brilliantly
illuminated.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Battle of the Chemists</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Some</span> years ago the nations of the world
gathered at the city of The Hague, in Holland,
to see what could be done to put an end to
war. They did not accomplish much in that direction,
but they did draw up certain rules of
warfare which they agreed to abide by. There
were some practices which were considered too
horrible for any civilized nation to indulge in.
Among these was the use of poisonous gases,
and Germany was one of the nations that took
a solemn pledge not to use gas in war.</p>

<p>Eighteen years later the German Army had
dug itself into a line of trenches reaching from
the English Channel to Switzerland, and facing
them in another line of trenches were the armies
of France and England, determined to hold back
the invaders. Neither side could make an advance
without frightful loss of life. But a
German scientist came forth with a scheme for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
breaking the dead-lock. This was Professor
Nernst, the inventor of a well-known electric
lamp and a man who had always violently hated
the British. His plan was to drown out the
British with a flood of poisonous gas. To be
sure, there was the pledge taken at The Hague
Conference, but why should that stand in Germany's
way? What cared the Germans for
promises now? Already they had broken a
pledge in their violation of Belgium. Already
they had rained explosives from the sky on unfortified
British cities (thus violating another
pledge of The Hague Conference); already they
had determined to war on defenseless merchantmen.
To them promises meant nothing, if such
promises interfered with the success of German
arms. They led the world in the field of chemistry;
why, they reasoned, shouldn't they make
use of this advantage?</p>

<h3>POURING GAS LIKE WATER</h3>

<p>It was really a new mode of warfare that the
Germans were about to launch and it called for
much study. In the first place, they had to decide
what sort of gas to use. It must be a gas
that could be obtained in large quantities. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
must be a very poisonous gas, that would act
quickly on the enemy; it must be easily compressed
and liquefied so that it could be carried
in containers that were not too bulky; it must
vaporize when the pressure was released; and
it must be heavier than air, so that it would not
be diluted by the atmosphere but would hug the
ground. You can pour gas just as you pour
water, if it is heavier than air. A heavy gas
will stay in the bottom of an unstoppered bottle
and can be poured from one bottle into another
like water. If the gas is colored, you can see
it flowing just as if it were a liquid. On the
other hand, a gas which is much lighter than
air can also be kept in unstoppered bottles if
the bottles are turned upside down, and the gas
can be poured from one bottle into another; but
it flows up instead of down.</p>

<p>Chlorine gas was selected because it seemed
to meet all requirements. For the gas attack
a point was chosen where the ground sloped
gently toward the opposing lines, so that the
gas would actually flow down hill into them.
Preparations were carried out with the utmost
secrecy. Just under the parapet of the trenches
deep pits were dug, about a yard apart on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
front of fifteen miles, or over twenty-five thousand
pits. In these pits were placed the chlorine
tanks, each weighing about ninety pounds.
Each pit was then closed with a plank and this
was covered with a quilt filled with peat moss
soaked in potash, so that in case of any leakage
the chlorine would be taken up by the potash
and rendered harmless. Over the quilts sandbags
were piled to a considerable height, to
protect the tanks from shell-fragments.</p>

<p>Liquid chlorine will boil even in a temperature
of 28 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, but
in tanks it cannot boil because there is no room
for it to turn into a gas. Upon release of the
pressure at ordinary temperatures, the liquid
boils violently and big clouds of gas are produced.
If the gas were tapped off from the top
of the cylinder, it would freeze on pouring out,
because any liquid that turns into a gas has to
draw heat from its surroundings. The greater
the expansion, the more heat the gas absorbs,
and in the case of the chlorine tanks, had the
nozzles been set in the top of the tank they
would very quickly have been crusted with frost
and choked, stopping the flow.</p>

<p>But the Germans had anticipated this difficulty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
and instead of drawing off the gas from
the top of the tank, they drew off the liquid
from the bottom in small leaden tubes which
passed up through the liquid in the tank and
were kept as warm as the surrounding liquid.
In fact, it was not gas from the top of the tank,
but liquid from the bottom, that was streamed
out and this did not turn into gas until it had
left the nozzle.</p>

<h3>WAITING FOR THE WIND</h3>

<p>Everything was ready for the attack on the
British in April, 1915. A point had been chosen
where the British lines made a juncture with
the French. The Germans reckoned that a
joint of this sort in the opponent's lines would
be a spot of weakness. Also, they had very
craftily picked out this particular spot because
the French portion of the line was manned by
Turcos, or Algerians, who would be likely to
think there was something supernatural about
a death-dealing cloud. On the left of the Africans
was a division of Canadians, but the main
brunt of the gas was designed to fall upon the
Turcos. Several times the attack was about
to be made, but was abandoned because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
wind was not just right. The Germans wished
to pick out a time when the breeze was blowing
steadily&mdash;not so fast as to scatter the gas, but
yet so fast that it would overtake men who attempted
to run away from it. It was not until
April 22 that conditions were ideal, and then
the new mode of warfare was launched.</p>

<p>Just as had been expected, the Turcos were
awe-struck when they saw, coming out of the
German trenches, volumes of greenish-yellow
gas, which rolled toward them, pouring down
into shell-holes and flowing over into the
trenches as if it were a liquid. They were
seized with superstitious fear, particularly when
the gas overcame numbers of them, stifling
them and leaving them gasping for breath. Immediately
there was a panic and they raced
back, striving to out-speed the pursuing
cloud.</p>

<p>For a stretch of fifteen miles the Allied
trenches were emptied, and the Germans, who
followed in the wake of the gas, met with no opposition
except in the sector held by the Canadians.
Here, on the fringe of the gas cloud, so
determined a fight was put up that the Germans
faltered, and the brave Canadians held them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
until reinforcements arrived and the gap in the
line was closed.</p>

<p>The Germans themselves were new at the
game or they could have made a complete success
of this surprise attack. Had they made the
attack on a broader front, nothing could have
kept them from breaking through to Calais.
The valiant Canadians who struggled and
fought without protection in the stifling clouds
of chlorine, were almost wiped out. But many
of them who were on the fringe of the cloud escaped
by wetting handkerchiefs, socks, or other
pieces of cloth, and wrapping them around their
mouths and noses.</p>

<p>The world was horrified when it read of this
German gas attack, but there was no time to be
lost. Immediately orders went out for gas-masks,
and in all parts of England, and of
France as well, women were busy sewing the
masks. These were very simple affairs&mdash;merely
a pad of cotton soaked in washing-soda
and arranged to be tied over the mouth and nose.
But when the next attack came, not long after
the first, the men were prepared in some measure
for it, and again it failed to bring the Germans
the success they had counted upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
One thing that the Germans had not counted
upon was the fact that the prevailing winds in
Flanders blow from west to east. During the
entire summer and autumn of 1915, the winds
refused to favor them, and no gas attacks were
staged from June to December. This gave the
British a long respite and enabled them not only
to prepare better gas-masks, but also to make
plans to give the Hun a dose of his own medicine.</p>

<h3>WHEN THE WIND PLAYED A TRICK ON THE GERMANS</h3>

<p>There were many disadvantages in the use
of gas clouds, which developed as the Germans
gathered experience. The gas started from
their own lines in a very dense cloud, but the
cloud grew thinner and thinner as it traveled
toward the enemy, and lost a great deal of its
strength. If the wind were higher than fifteen
miles an hour, it would swirl the gas around and
dissipate it before it did much harm to the opposing
fighters. If the wind were light, there
were other dangers. On one occasion in 1916
a cloud of gas was released upon an Irish regiment.
The wind was rather fickle. It carried
the gas toward the British trenches, but before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
reaching them the cloud hesitated, the wind
veered around, and soon the gas began to pour
back upon the German lines. The Germans
were entirely unprepared for this boomerang
attack. Many of the Huns had no gas-masks
on, and those who had, found that the masks
were not in proper working-order. As a result
of this whim of the winds, eleven thousand Germans
were killed.</p>

<div id="ip_93" class="figcenter" style="width: 346px;">

  <div class="captionl">Courtesy of "Scientific American"</div>

<div class="caption0">Cleaning Up a Dugout with the "Fire Broom"</div></div>

<p>While chlorine was the first gas used, it was
evident that it was not the only one that could
be employed. British chemists had suspected
that the Germans would use phosgene, which
was a much more deadly gas, and in the long interval
between June and December, 1915, masks
were constructed which would keep out not only
the fumes of chlorine but also the more poisonous
phosgene. In one of their sorties the British
succeeded in capturing some valuable notes
on gas attacks, belonging to a German general,
which showed that the Germans were actually
preparing to use phosgene. This deadly gas is
more insidious in its action than chlorine. The
man who inhales phosgene may not know that
he is gassed. He may experience no ill effects,
but hours afterward, particularly if he has exercised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
in the meantime, he may suddenly fall
dead, owing to its paralyzing action on the heart.</p>

<h3>FREEING THE BRITISH TRENCHES OF RATS</h3>

<p>Phosgene was not used alone, but had to be
mixed with chlorine, and the deadly combination
of the two destroyed all life for miles behind
the trenches. However, the British were
ready for it. They had been drilled to put on
their masks in a few seconds' time, on the first
warning of a gas attack. When the clouds of
chlorine and phosgene came over No Man's
Land, they were prepared, and, except for casualties
among men whose masks proved defective,
the soldiers in the trenches came through
with very few losses. All animal life, however,
was destroyed. This was a blessing to the British
Tommy, whose trenches had been overrun
with rats. The British had tried every known
method to get rid of these pests, and now, thanks
to the Germans, their quarters were most effectively
fumigated with phosgene and every rat
was killed. If only the "cooties" could have
been destroyed in the same way, the Germans
might have been forgiven many of their offenses.</p>

<p>The disadvantages in the use of gas clouds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
became increasingly apparent. What was
wanted was some method of placing the gas
among the opponents in concentrated form,
without wasting any of it on its way across from
one line to the other. This led to the use of
shell filled with materials which would produce
gas. There were many advantages in these
shell. They could be thrown exactly where it
was desired that they should fall, without the
help of the fickle winds. When the shell landed
and burst, the full effect of its contents was
expended upon the enemy. A gas cloud would
rise over a wood, but with shell the wood could
be filled with gas, which, once there, would lurk
among the trees for days. Chemicals could be
used in shell which could not be used in a cloud
attack. The shell could be filled with a liquid,
or even with a solid, because when it burst the
filling would be minutely pulverized. And so
German chemists were set to work devising all
sorts of fiendish schemes for poisoning, choking,
or merely annoying their opponents.</p>

<h3>GAS THAT MADE ONE WEEP</h3>

<p>One of the novel shell the Germans used was
known as the "tear-gas" shell. This was filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
with a liquid, the vapor of which was very irritating
to the eyes. The liquid vaporized very
slowly and so its effect would last a long time.
However, the vapor did not permanently injure
the eyes; it merely filled them with tears to such
an extent that a soldier was unable to see and
consequently was confused and retarded in his
work. The "tear-gas" shell were marked with
a "T" by the Germans and were known as
"T-shell."</p>

<p>Another type of shell, known as the
"K-shell," contained a very poisonous liquid,
the object of which was to destroy the enemy
quickly. The effect of this shell was felt at
once, but it left no slow vapors on the ground,
and so it could be followed up almost immediately
by an attack. Later on, the Germans developed
three types of gas shell&mdash;one known as
the "Green Cross," another as the "Yellow
Cross," and the third as the "Blue Cross."
The Green Cross shell was filled with diphosgene,
or a particularly dangerous combination
of phosgene in liquid form, which would remain
in pools on the ground or soak into the ground
and would vaporize when it became warm. Its
vapors were deadly. One had always to be on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
his guard against them. In the morning, when
the sun warmed the earth and vapors were seen
to rise from the damp soil, tests were made of
the vapors to see whether it was mere water
vapor or diphosgene, before men were allowed
to walk through it.</p>

<p>These vapors were heavier than air and would
flow down into a trench, filling every nook and
cranny. If phosgene entered a trench by a direct
hit, the liquid would remain there for days,
rendering that part of the trench uninhabitable
except by men in gas-masks. The infected part
of the trench, however, was cut off from the
rest of the trench by means of gas-locks. In
other words, blankets were used to keep the gas
out, and usually two blankets were hung so that
a man in passing from one part of the trench
to another could lift up the first blanket, pass
under it, and close it carefully behind him before
opening the second blanket which led into
the portion of the trench that was not infected.</p>

<p>The Germans had all sorts of fiendish schemes
for increasing the discomfort of the Allies.
For instance, to some of their diphosgene shell
they added a gas which caused intense vomiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
The Yellow Cross shell was another fiendish
invention of the Huns. It was popularly known
as "mustard gas" and was intended not to
kill but merely to discomfort the enemy. The
gas had a peculiar penetrating smell, something
like garlic, and its fumes would burn the
flesh wherever it was exposed to them, producing
great blisters and sores that were most
distressing. The material in the shell was a
liquid which was very hard to get rid of because
it would vaporize so slowly. On account of the
persistence of this vapor, lasting as it did for
days, these gas shell were usually not fired
by the Germans on lines that they expected to
attack immediately.</p>

<h3>THE SNEEZING-SHELL</h3>

<p>The Blue Cross shell was comparatively
harmless, although very annoying. It contained
a solid which was atomized by the explosion
of the shell, and which, after it got
into the nostrils, caused a violent sneezing.
The material, however, was not poisonous and
did not produce any casualties to speak of,
although it was most unpleasant. A storm of
Blue Cross shell could be followed almost immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
by an attack, because the effect of
the shell would have been dissipated before
the attackers reached the enemy who were still
suffering from the irritation of their nostrils.</p>

<h3>GAS-MASKS</h3>

<p>As the different kinds of gas shell were developed,
the gas-masks were improved to meet
them. In every attack there were "duds" or
unexploded shell, which the chemists of the
Allies analyzed. Also, they were constantly
experimenting with new gases, themselves, and
often could anticipate the Germans. The Allies
were better able to protect themselves against
gas attacks than the Germans, because
there was a scarcity of rubber in Germany
for the manufacture of masks. When it was
found that phosgene was going to be used, the
simple cotton-wad masks had to give way to
more elaborate affairs with chemicals that
would neutralize this deadly gas. And later
when the mustard gas was used which attacked
the eyes, and the sneezing-gas that attacked the
nose, it was found necessary to cover the face
completely, particularly the eyes; and so helmets
of rubber were constructed which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
tightly fitted around the neck under the coat
collar. The inhaled air was purified by passage
through a box or can filled with chemicals
and charcoal made of various materials, such as
cocoanut shells, peach pits, horse-chestnuts, and
the like. Because the Germans had no rubber
to spare, they were obliged to use leather, which
made their masks stiff and heavy.</p>

<h3>GLASS THAT WILL NOT SHATTER</h3>

<p>One of the greatest difficulties that had to be
contended with was the covering of the eyes.
There was danger in the use of glass, because
it was liable to be cracked or broken, letting in
the deadly fumes and gassing the wearer. Experiments
were made with celluloid and similar
materials, but the finest gas-masks produced
in the war were those made for our own soldiers,
in which the goggles were of glass, built up in
layers, with a celluloid-like material between,
which makes a tough composition that will
stand up against a very hard blow. Even if
it cracks, this glass will not shatter.</p>

<p>The glasses were apt to become coated on
the inside with moisture coming from the perspiration
of the face, and some means had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
provided for wiping them off. The French hit
upon a clever scheme of having the inhaled air
strike the glasses in a jet which would dry off
the moisture and keep the glasses clear. Before
this was done, the masks were provided
with little sponges on the end of a finger-piece,
with which the glasses could be wiped dry without
taking the masks off.</p>

<p>But all this time, the Allies were not merely
standing on the defensive. No sooner had the
Germans launched their first attack than the
British and French chemists began to pay back
the Hun in kind. More attention was paid to
the shell than the cloud attack, and soon gas
shell began to rain upon the Germans. Not
only were the German shell copied, but new
gases were tried. Gas shell were manufactured
in immense quantities.</p>

<p>Then America took a hand in the war and
our chemists added their help, while our factories
turned out steady streams of shell. If
Germany wanted gas warfare, the Allies were
determined that she should have it. Our chemists
were not afraid to be pitted against the
German chemists and the factories of the Allies
were more than a match for those of the Central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Powers. When the Germans first started
the use of gas, apparently they counted only
their own success, which they thought would
be immediate and overwhelming. They soon
learned that they must take what they gave.
The Allies set them a pace that they could not
keep up with.</p>

<p>When the armistice brought the war to a
sudden stop, the United States alone was making
each day two tons of gas for every mile of
the western front. If the war had continued,
the Germans would have been simply deluged.
As it was, they were getting far more gas than
they could possibly produce in their own factories
and they had plenty of reason to regret
their rash disregard of their contract at The
Hague Conference. One gas we were making
was of the same order as mustard gas but far
more volatile, and had we had a chance to use
it against the Germans they would have found
it very difficult to protect themselves against its
penetrating fumes.</p>

<h3>BATTLING WITH LIQUID FIRE</h3>

<p>Somewhat associated with gas warfare was
another form of offensive which was introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
with the purpose of breaking up the dead-lock
of trench warfare. A man could protect himself
against gas by using a suitable mask and
clothing, but what could he do against fire?
It looked as if trench defenders would have to
give up if attacked with fire, and so, early in the
war, the Germans devised apparatus for shooting
forth streams of liquid fire, and the Allies
were not slow to copy the idea.</p>

<p>The apparatus was either fixed or portable,
but it was not often that the fixed apparatus
could be used to advantage, because at best the
range of the flame-thrower was limited and in
few places were the trenches near enough for
flaming oil to be thrown across the intervening
gap. For this reason portable apparatus was
chiefly used, with which a man could send out a
stream for from a hundred to a hundred and
fifty feet. On his back he carried the oil-tank,
in the upper part of which there was a charge
of compressed air. A pipe led from the tank
to a nozzle which the man held in his hand,
using it to direct the spray.</p>

<p>There was some danger to the operator in
handling a highly inflammable oil. The blaze
might flare back and burn him, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
when he was lighting the stream, and so a
special way of setting fire to the spray had to be
devised. Of course, the value of the apparatus
lay in its power to shoot the stream as far as
possible. The compressed air would send the
stream to a good distance, but after lighting,
the oil might be consumed before it reached the
desired range. Some way had to be found of
igniting the oil stream far from the nozzle or
as near the limit of its range as possible. And
so two nozzles were used, one with a small opening
so that it would send out a fine jet of long
range, while the main stream of oil issued from
the second nozzle. The first nozzle was movable
with respect to the second and the two
streams could be regulated to come together at
any desired distance from the operator within
the range of the apparatus. The fine stream
was ignited and carried the flame out to the
main stream, setting fire to it near the limit of
its range. In this way a flare-back was avoided
and the oil blazed where the flame was needed.
The same sort of double nozzle was used on the
stationary apparatus and because weight was
not a consideration, heavier apparatus was used
which shot the stream to a greater distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
But flame-throwing apparatus had its drawbacks:
there was always the danger that the
tank of highly inflammable oil might be burst
open by a shell or hand-grenade and its contents
set on fire. The fixed apparatus was
buried under bags of sand, but the man who
carried flame-throwing apparatus on his back
had to take his chances, not knowing at what
instant the oil he carried might be set ablaze,
turning him into a living, writhing, human
torch. Because of this hazard, liquid fire did
not play a very important part in trench warfare;
to set fire to the spray at its source with
a well directed hand-grenade was too easy.</p>

<h3>THE "FIRE BROOM"</h3>

<p>There were certain situations, however, in
which liquid fire played a very important part.
After a line of trenches had been captured it
was difficult to clear out the enemy who lurked
in dugouts and underground passages. They
would not surrender, and from their hidden
recesses they could pour out a deadly machine-gun
fire. The only way of dislodging them
was to use the "fire broom." In other words,
a stream of liquid fire was poured into the dugout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
burning out the men trapped in it. If
there were a second exit, they would come tumbling
out in a hurry. If not, they would be
burned to death. After the first sweep of the
"broom," if there were any survivors, there
would not be any fight left in them, and they
would be quick to surrender before being subjected
to a second dose of fire.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">There</span> is no race-horse that can keep up
with an automobile, no deer that can out-run
a locomotive. A bicyclist can soon tire out
the hardiest of hounds. Why? Because animals
run on legs, while machines run on wheels.</p>

<p>As wheels are so much more speedy than legs,
it seems odd that we do not find this form of
locomotion in nature. There are many animals
that owe their very existence to the fact that
they can run fast. Why hasn't nature put
them on wheels so that when their enemy appears
they can roll away, sedately, instead of
having to jerk their legs frantically back and
forth at the rate of a hundred strokes a minute?</p>

<p>But one thing we must not overlook. Our
wheeled machines must have a special road
prepared for them, either a macadam highway
or a steel track. They are absolutely helpless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
when they are obliged to travel over rough
country. No wheeled vehicle can run through
fields broken by ditches and swampy spots, or
over ground obstructed with boulders and tree-stumps.</p>

<p>But it is not always possible or practicable
to build a road for the machines to travel upon,
and it is necessary to have some sort of self-propelled
vehicle that can travel over all kinds
of ground.</p>

<p>Some time ago a British inventor developed
a machine with large wheels on which were
mounted the equivalent of feet. As the wheels
revolved, these feet would be planted firmly on
the ground, one after the other, and the machine
would proceed step by step. It could travel
over comparatively rough ground, and could
actually walk up a flight of stairs. We have a
very curious walking-machine in this country.
It is a big dredge provided with two broad
feet and a "swivel chair." The machine
makes progress by alternately planting its feet
on the ground, lifting itself up, chair and all,
pushing itself forward, and sitting down again.</p>

<p>Although many other types of walking-machines
have been patented, none of them has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
amounted to very much. Clearly, nature hopelessly
outclasses us in this form of propulsion.</p>

<p>Years ago it occured to one ingenious man
that if wheeled machines must have tracks or
roads for their wheels to run on, they might be
allowed to lay their own tracks. And so he
arranged his track in the form of an endless
chain of plates that ran around the wheels of
his machine. The wheels merely rolled on this
chain, and as they progressed, new links of the
track were laid down before them and the links
they had passed over were picked up behind
them. A number of inventors worked on this
idea, but one man in particular, Benjamin Holt,
of Peoria, Illinois, brought the invention to a
high state of perfection. He arranged a series
of wheels along the chain track, each carrying
a share of the load of the machine, and each
mounted on springs so that it would yield to
any unevenness of the ground, just as a caterpillar
conforms itself to the hills and dales of
the surface it creeps over. In fact, the machine
was called a "caterpillar" tractor because
of its crawling locomotion.</p>

<p>But it was no worm of a machine. In power
it was a very elephant. It could haul loads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
that would tax the strength of scores of horses.
Stumps and boulders were no obstacles in its
path. Even ditches could not bar its progress.
The machine would waddle down one bank
and up the other without the slightest difficulty.
It was easily steered; in fact, it could
turn around in its own length by traveling forward
on one of its chains, or traction-belts,
and backward on the other. The machine was
particularly adapted to travel on soft or plowed
ground, because the broad traction-belts gave
it a very wide bearing and spread its weight
over a large surface. It was set to work on
large farms, hauling gangs of plows and cultivators.
Little did Mr. Holt think, as he
watched his powerful mechanical elephants at
work on the vast Western wheat-fields, that
they, or rather their offspring, would some day
play a leading role in a war that would rack the
whole world.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>But we are getting ahead of our story. To
start at the very beginning, we must go back
to the time when the first savage warrior used
a plank of wood to protect himself from the
rocks hurled by his enemy. This was the start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
of the never-ending competition between arms
and armor. As the weapons of offense developed
from stone to spear, to arrow, to arquebus,
the wooden plank developed into a shield
of brass and then of steel; and then, since a
separate shield became too bothersome to
carry, it was converted into armor that the
warrior could wear and so have both hands free
for battle. For every improvement in arms
there was a corresponding improvement in
armor.</p>

<p>After gunpowder was invented, the idea of
armor for men began to wane, because no armor
could be built strong enough to ward off the
rifle-bullet and at the same time light enough
for a man to wear. The struggle between arms
and armor was then confined to the big guns
and the steel protection of forts and war-ships.</p>

<p>But not so long ago the machine-gun was invented,
and this introduced a new phase of warfare.
Not more than one rifle-bullet in a thousand
finds its mark on the battle-field. The
Boers in the battle of Colenso established a
record with one hit in six hundred shots. In
the excitement of battle men are too nervous to
take careful aim and they are apt to fire either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
too high or too low, so that the mortality is
not nearly so great as some would expect. But
with the machine-gun there is not this waste of
ammunition, because it fires a stream of
bullets, the effect of which can readily be determined
by the man who operates the volley. The
difference between the machine-gun fire and
rifle fire is something like the difference between
hitting a tin can with a stone or with a stream of
water. It is no easy matter to score a hit with
the stone; but any one can train a garden hose
on the can, because he can see where the water is
striking and move his hose accordingly until he
covers the desired spot. In the same way,
with the machine-gun, it is much easier to train
the stream of bullets upon the mark, and, having
once found the mark, to hold the aim. That is
one reason why the destruction of a machine-gun
is so tremendous; another, of course, being
that it will discharge so many more shots per
minute than the common rifle.</p>

<div class="caption0">British Tank Climbing out of a Trench at Cambrai</div></div>

<p>In the Russo-Japanese War, the Russians
played havoc with the attacking Japanese at
Port Arthur by using carefully concealed machine-guns,
and the German military attachés
were quick to note the value of the machine-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>gun.
Secretely they manufactured large numbers
of machine-guns and established a special
branch of service to handle the guns, and they
developed the science of using them with telling
effect. And so, when the recent great war suddenly
broke out, they surprised the world with
the countless number of machine-guns they possessed
and the efficient use to which they put
them. Thousands of British soldiers in the
early days of the war fell victims to these death-dealing
machines. Two or three men with a
machine-gun could defy several companies of
soldiers, especially when the attackers had to
cut their way through barbed wire entanglements.
It was clearly evident that something
must be done to defend the men against the
machine-gun; for to charge against it meant,
simply, wholesale slaughter.</p>

  <div class="caption0">The German Tank was very heavy and cumbersome</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>At first the only means of combating the machine-guns
seemed to be to destroy them with
shell-fire; but they were carefully concealed,
and it was difficult to search them out. Only
by long-continued bombardment was it possible
to destroy them and tear away the barbed wire
sufficiently to permit of a charge. Before an
enemy position was stormed it was subjected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
the fire of thousands of guns of all calibers for
hours and even days.</p>

<p>But this resulted in notifying the enemy that
a charge was ere long to be attempted at a
certain place, and he could assemble his reserves
for a counter-attack. Furthermore, the Germans
learned to conceal their machine-guns in
dugouts twenty or thirty feet underground,
where they were safe from the fire of the big
guns, and then, when the fire let up, the weapons
would be dragged up to the surface in time to
mow down the approaching infantry.</p>

<p>It was very clear that something would have
to be done to combat the machine-gun. If the
necessary armor was too heavy for the men
to carry, it must carry itself. Armored automobiles
were of no service at all, because they
could not possibly travel over the shell-pitted
ground of No Man's Land. The Russians
tried a big steel shield mounted on wheels,
which a squad of soldiers would push ahead
of them, but their plan failed because the wheels
would get stuck in shell-holes. A one-man
shield on wheels was tried by the British. Under
its shelter a man could steal up to the barbed
wire and cut it and even crawl up to a machine-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>gun
emplacement and destroy it with a hand-grenade.
But this did not prove very successful,
either, because the wheels did not take
kindly to the rough ground of the battle-field.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>And here is where we come back to Mr.
Holt's mechanical elephants. Just before the
great war broke out, Belgium&mdash;poor unsuspecting
Belgium&mdash;was holding an agricultural
exhibit. An American tractor was on exhibition.
It was the one developed by Mr.
Holt, and its remarkable performances gained
for it a reputation that spread far and
wide. Colonel E.&nbsp;D. Swinton of the British
Army heard of the peculiar machine, and immediately
realized the advantages of an armored
tractor for battle over torn ground.
But in the first few months of the war that
ensued, this idea was forgotten, until the effectiveness
of the machine-gun and the necessity
for overcoming it recalled the matter
to his mind. At his suggestion a caterpillar
tractor was procured, and the military engineers
set themselves to the task of designing an
armored body to ride on the caterpillar-tractor
belts. Of course the machine had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
entirely re-designed. The tractor was built for
hauling loads, and not to climb out of deep shell-holes;
but by running the traction-belts over
the entire body of the car, and running the
forward part of the tractor up at a sharp angle
the engineers overcame that difficulty.</p>

<p>In war, absolute secrecy is essential to the
success of any invention, and the British engineers
were determined to let no inkling of
the new armored automobiles reach the enemy.
Different parts of the machines were made in
different factories, so that no one would have
an idea of what the whole would look like. At
first the new machine was known as a "land-cruiser"
or "land-ship"; but it was feared that
this very name would give a clue to spies, and
so any descriptive name was forbidden. Many
of the parts consisted of rolled steel plates
which might readily be used in building up vessels
to hold water or gasolene; and to give the
impression that such vessels were being constructed
the name "tank" was adopted. The
necessity of guarding even the name of the machines
was shown later, when rumors leaked
out that the tanks were being built to carry
water over the desert regions of Mesopotamia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
and Egypt. Another curious rumor was that
the machines were snow-plows for use in Russia.
To give some semblance of truth to this
story, the parts were carefully labeled, "For
Petrograd."</p>

<p>Probably never was a military secret so well
guarded as this one, and when, on September
15, 1916, the waddling steel tractors loomed up
out of the morning mists, the German fighters
were taken completely by surprise. Two days
before, their airmen had noticed some peculiar
machines which they supposed were armored
automobiles. They had no idea, however, that
such formidable monsters were about to descend
upon them.</p>

<p>The tanks proceeded leisurely over the shell-torn
regions of No Man's Land, wallowing
down into shell-holes and clambering up out of
them with perfect ease. They straddled the
trenches and paused to pour down them streams
of machine-gun bullets. Wire entanglements
were nothing to them; under their weight steel
wire snapped like thread. The big brutes
marched up and down the lines of wire, treading
them down into the ground and clearing the way
for the infantry. Even trees were no barrier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
to these tanks. Of course they did not attack
large ones, but the smallish trees were simply
broken down before their onslaughts. As for
concrete emplacements for machine-guns, the
tanks merely rode over them and crushed them.
Those who attempted to defend themselves in
the ruins of buildings found that the tanks
could plow right through walls and bring them
down in a shower of bricks and stone. There
was no stopping these monsters, and the Germans
fled in consternation before them.</p>

<p>There were two sizes of tanks. The larger
ones aimed to destroy the machine-gun emplacements,
and they were fitted up with guns for firing
a shell. The smaller tanks, armed with
machine-guns, devoted themselves to fighting
the infantry. British soldiers following in the
wake of the bullet-proof tank were protected
from the shots of the enemy and were ready to
attack him with bayonets when the time was
ripe. But the tanks also furnished an indirect
protection for the troops. It was not necessary
for the men to conceal themselves behind the
big tractors. Naturally, every Hun who stood
his ground and fought, directed all his fire upon
the tanks, leaving the British infantry free to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
charge virtually unmolested. The success of
the tank was most pronounced.</p>

<p>In the meantime the French had been informed
of the plans of their allies, and they set
to work on a different design of tractor. It
was not until six months later that their machines
saw service. The French design differed
from the British mainly in having the
tractor belt confined to the wheels instead of
running over the entire body of the tank. It
was more blunt than the British and was provided
at the forward end with a steel cutting-edge,
which adapted it to break its way through
wire entanglements. At each end there are two
upward-turning skids which helped the tank
to lift itself out of a hole. The larger machines
carried a regular 75-millimeter (3-inch) field-gun,
which is a very formidable weapon. They
carried a crew of one officer and seven men.</p>

<p>Life in a tank is far from pleasant. The heat
and the noise of machinery and guns are terrific.
Naturally, ventilation is poor and the fumes and
gases that accumulate are most annoying, to
say the least. Sometimes the men were overcome
by them. But war is war, and such discomforts
had to be endured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
But the tank possessed one serious defect
which the Germans were not slow to discover.
Its armor was proof against machine-gun fire,
but it could not ward off the shells of field-guns,
and it was such a slow traveler that the
enemy did not find it a very difficult task to
hit it with a rapid-fire gun if the gunner could
see his target. And so the Germans ordered up
their guns to the front lines, where they could
score direct hits. Only light guns were used
for this purpose, especially those whose rifling
was worn down by long service, because
long range was not necessary for tank
fighting.</p>

</div></div>

<p>When the Germans began their final great
drive, it was rumored that they had built some
monster tanks that were far more formidable
than anything the Allies had produced. Unlike
the British, they used the tanks not to lead
the army but to follow and destroy small nests
of French and British that were left behind.
When the French finally did capture one of the
German tanks, which had fallen into a quarry,
it proved to be a poor imitation. It was an
ugly-looking affair, very heavy and cumbersome.
Owing to the scarcity of materials for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
producing high-grade armor, it had to make
up in thickness of plating what it lacked in
quality of steel. The tank was intended to
carry a crew of eighteen men and it fairly
bristled with guns, but it could not man&oelig;uver
as well as the British tank; for when some
weeks later a fleet of German tanks encountered
a fleet of heavy British tanks, the Hun machines
were completely routed.</p>

<div class="captionh0">Section through our Mark VIII Tank showing the layout of the interior with the locations
of the most important parts in the fighting compartment in the engine room</div></div>

<p>It was then that the British sprang another
surprise upon the Germans. After the big
fellows had done their work, a lot of baby tanks
appeared on the scene and chased the German
infantry. These little tanks could travel at a
speed of twelve miles an hour, which is about
as fast as an ordinary man can run. "Whippets,"
the British called them, because they
were like the speedy little dogs of that name.
They carried but two men, one to guide the tank
and the other to operate the machine-gun. The
French, too, built a light "mosquito" tank,
which was even smaller than the British tank,
and fully as fast. It was with these machines,
which could dart about quickly on the battle-field
and dodge the shell of the field-guns, and
which were immune to the fire of the machine-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>gun,
that the Allies were able to make progress
against the Germans.</p>

<p>When the Germans retired, they left behind
them nests of machine-guns to cover the withdrawal
of their armies. These gunners were
ordered to fight to the very end. They looked
for no mercy and expected no help. Had it
not been for the light tanks, it would have been
well nigh impossible to overcome these determined
bodies of men without frightful losses.</p>

<p>Since America invented the machine-gun and
also barbed wire, and since America furnished
the inspiration for the tank with which to trample
down the wire entanglements and stamp out
the machine-guns, naturally people expected
our army to come out with something better
than anything produced by our allies. We did
turn out a number of heavy machines patterned
after the original British tank, with armor that
could stand up against heavy fire, and we also
produced a small and very speedy tank similar
to the French "baby" tank, but before we could
put these into service the war ended. The
tanks we did use so effectively at St.-Mihiel
and in the Argonne Forest were supplied by
the French.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The War in the Air</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">We</span> Americans are a peace-loving people,
which is the very reason why we went
into the war. We had to help down the
power that was disturbing the peace of the
world. We do not believe in conquests&mdash;at
least of the type that Germany tried to force&mdash;and
yet there are certain conquests that we
do indulge in once in a while.</p>

<p>Eleven years before Germany undertook to
conquer Europe two young Americans made the
greatest conquest that the world has ever seen.
The Wright brothers sailed up into the heavens
and gained the mastery of the air. They offered
their conquest to the United States; but
while we accepted their offering with enthusiasm
at first, we did not know what to do with
the new realm after we got it. There seemed
to be no particular use in flying. It was just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
a bit too risky to be pleasant sport, and about
all we could see in it was an exhibition for the
circus or the county fair.</p>

<p>Not so in Europe, however. Flying meant
something over there&mdash;there where the frontiers
have ever bristled with big guns and
strong fortifications, and where huge military
forces have slept on their arms, never knowing
what dreadful war the morning would bring
forth. The war-lovers hailed the airplane as
a new instrument with which to terrorize their
neighbors; the peace-lovers saw in it another
menace to their homes; it gave them a new frontier
to defend. And so the military powers of
Europe took up the airplane seriously and
earnestly and developed it.</p>

<p>At first military authorities had rated the
airplane chiefly as a flying scout. Some bomb-dropping
experiments had been made with it,
but it proved very difficult to land the bombs
near the target, and, besides, machines of those
days were not built to carry very heavy loads,
so that it did not seem especially profitable to
attack the enemy from the skies. As for actual
battles up among the clouds, they were dreamed
of only by the writers of fiction. But wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
dreams became stern realities in the mighty
struggle between the great powers of the world.</p>

<h3>EYES IN THE SKY</h3>

<p>As a scouting-machine the airplane did
prove to be far superior to mounted patrols
which used to perform scout-work. In fact, it
changed completely the character of modern
warfare. From his position high up in the
heavens the flying scout had an unobstructed
view of the country for miles and he could see
just what the enemy was doing. He could see
whether large forces of men were collecting for
an attack. He could watch the course of supply-trains,
and judge of their size. He could
locate the artillery of the enemy and come back
with information which in former times a scout
posted in a tall tree or even in a captive balloon
could not begin to acquire. Surprise attacks
were impossible, with eyes in the sky. The
aviator could help his own batteries by signaling
to them where to send their shell, and when
the firing began he would spot the shots as they
landed and signal back to the battery how to
correct its aim so as to drop the shell squarely
on the target.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
The French sprang a surprise on the Germans
by actually attacking the infantry from
the sky. The idea of attack from overhead
was so novel that armies did not realize the
danger of exposing themselves behind the battle-front.
Long convoys of trucks and masses
of infantry moved freely over the roads
behind the lines and they were taken by surprise
when the French began dropping steel
darts upon them. These were about the size
of a pencil, with pointed end and fluted tail,
so that they would travel through the air like
an arrow. The darts were dropped by the
hundred wherever the airmen saw a large
group of the enemy, and they struck with sufficient
velocity to pierce a man from head to
foot. But steel darts were not used very long.
The enemy took to cover and then the only way
to attack him was to drop explosives which
would blow up his shelter.</p>

<p>At the outset, air scouts were more afraid of
the enemy on the ground than in the sky. The
Germans had anti-aircraft guns that were fired
with accuracy and accounted for many Allied
planes. In those days, airplanes flew at comparatively
low altitudes and they were well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
within the reach of the enemy's guns. But it
was not long before the airplanes began to fight
one another. Each side was very much annoyed
by the flying scouts of its opponents and
after a number of pistol duels in the sky the
French began to arm their planes with machine-guns.</p>

<p>Two months after the war started the first
airplane was sent crashing to earth after a battle
in the sky. The fight took place five thousand
feet above the earth, between a French
and a German machine. The German pilot was
killed and the plane fell behind the French
lines, carrying with it a Prussian nobleman
who died before he could be pulled out of the
wreckage. The war had been carried into the
skies. But if scouts were to fight one another,
they could not pay much attention to scouting
and spotting and it began to be realized that
there were four distinct classes of work for the
airplane to do&mdash;scouting, artillery-spotting, battling,
and bombing. Each called for special
training and its own type of machine. As air
fighting grew more specialized these classes
were further subdivided, but we need not go into
such refinements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<h3>AIR SCOUTS AND THEIR DANGERS</h3>

<p>The scouting-airplane usually carried two
men, one to drive the machine and the other to
make observations. The observer had to carry
a camera, to take photographs of what lay below,
and he was usually equipped with a wireless
outfit, with which he could send important
information back to his own base. The camera
was sometimes fitted with a stock like that of
a gun, so that it could be aimed from the
shoulder. Some small cameras were shaped so
that they could be held in the hand like a pistol
and aimed over the side of the fuselage, or body,
of the airplane; but the best work was done with
large cameras fitted with telescopic lenses, or
"telephoto" lenses, as they are called. Some
of these were built into the airplane, with the
lens opening down through the bottom of the
fuselage.</p>

<div class="caption0">A Handley-Page Bombing Plane with One of its Wings Folded Back</div></div>

<p>The scouting-airplane carried a machine-gun,
not for attack, but for defense. It had to be a
quick climber and a good dodger, so that it
could escape from an attacking plane. Usually
it did not have to go very far into the enemy
country, and it was provided with a large wing-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>spread,
so that if anything happened to the
engine, it could <i>volplane</i>, or glide back, to its
own lines. As the scouting-planes were large,
they offered a big target to anti-aircraft guns,
and so the work of the air scout was to swoop
down upon the enemy, when, of course, the
machine would be traveling at high velocity,
because it would have all the speed of falling
added to that which its own propeller gave it.</p>

<div id="ip_129" class="figcenter" style="width: 271px;">
  <img src="images/i_129.jpg" width="271" height="505" alt="" /><br />
  <div class="captionh">How an object dropped from the Woolworth Building would
increase its speed in falling</div></div>

<p>It was really a very difficult matter to hit a
rapidly moving airplane; and even if it were
hit, there were few spots in which it could be
mortally wounded. Hundreds of shots could go
through the wings of an airplane without impairing
its flying in the least. The engine, too,
could be pretty well peppered with ordinary
bullets without being disabled. As for the men
in the machine, they furnished small targets,
and even they could be hit in many places without
being put entirely out of business. And so
the dangers of air scouting were not so great
as might at first be supposed.</p>

<p>One of the most vulnerable spots in the airplane
was the gasolene-tank. If that were
punctured so that the fuel would run out, the
airplane would have to come to the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Worse still, the gasolene might take fire and
there was nothing the aviator dreaded more
than fire. There were occasions in which he had
to choose between leaping to earth and burning
to death, and the former was usually preferred
as a quicker and less painful death.
In some of the later machines the gasolene-tank
could be pitched overboard if it took fire, by the
throwing of a lever, and then the aviator could
glide to earth in safety.</p>

<h3>THE SELF-HEALING GASOLENE-TANK</h3>

<p>One of the contributions which we made to
military aëronautics was a gasolene-tank that
was puncture-proof. It was made of soft rubber
with a thin lining of copper. There are
some very soft erasers on the market through
which you can pass a lead pencil and never find
the hole after it has passed through, because
the rubber has closed in and healed the wound.
Such was the rubber used in the gasolene-tank.
It could be peppered with bullets and yet would
not leak a drop of gasolene, unless the bullet
chanced to plow along the edge of the tank
and open a long gash.</p>

<p>The Germans used four different kinds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
cartridges in their aircraft guns. The first
carried the ordinary bullet, a second type had
for its bullet a shell of German silver filled with
a phosphor compound. This was automatically
ignited through a small opening in the base of
the shell when it was fired from the gun and it
left a trail of smoke by which the gunner could
trace its course through the air and correct his
aim. At night the bright spot of light made
by the burning compound would serve the same
purpose. Such a bullet, if it hit an ordinary
gasolene-tank, would set fire to its contents.
The bullet would plow through the tank and out
at the opposite side and there, at its point of
exit, is where the gasolene would be set on
fire. Such incendiary bullets were repeatedly
fired into or through the rubber tanks and the
hole would close behind the bullet, preventing
the contents from taking fire. The two other
types of bullets referred to were an explosive
bullet or tiny shell which would explode on
striking the target and a perforating steel bullet
which was intended to pierce armor or penetrate
into vital parts of an airplane engine.</p>

<p>Machines with which artillery-spotting was
done were usually manned by a pilot and an observer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
so that the latter could devote his entire
attention to noting the fire of the guns and
signaling ranges without being hampered by
having to drive the machine. These machines
were usually of the pusher type, so that the observer
could have an unobstructed view. They
did not have to be fast machines. It was really
better for them to move slowly. Had it been
possible for them to stop altogether and hover
over the spot that was being shelled, it would
have been a distinct advantage. That would
have given the observer a chance to note with
better accuracy the fall of the shell. Like the
scout, the spotter had to be a fast climber, so
that it could get out of the range of enemy guns
and run away from attacking planes.</p>

<h3>GIANTS OF THE SKY</h3>

<p>The largest war-planes were the bomb-dropping
machines. They had to be capable of
carrying heavy loads of explosives. They were
usually slow machines, speed being sacrificed
in carrying-capacity.</p>

<p>The Germans paid a great deal of attention
to big bomb-dropping machines, particularly
after their Zeppelins proved a failure. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
huge Gothas were built to make night raids on
undefended cities. The Italians and the British
retaliated with machines that were even larger.
At first the French were inclined to let giant
planes alone. They did not care to conduct
long-distance bombing-raids on German cities
because their own important cities were so near
the battle-front that the Germans could have
done those places more harm than the French
could have inflicted. Later they built some
giant machines, although not so large as those
of the Italians and the British.</p>

<p>The large triplane Capronis built by the
Italians held a crew of three men. They were
armed with three guns and carried 2750 pounds
of explosives. That made a useful load of 4000
pounds. The machine was driven by three engines
with a total of 900 horse-power.</p>

<p>The big British plane was the Handley-Page,
which had a wing-spread of 125 feet and could
carry a useful load of three tons. These enormous
machines conducted their raids at night
because they were comparatively slow and could
not defend themselves against speedy battle-planes.
The big Italian machines used "search-light"
bombs to help them locate important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
points on the ground beneath. These were
brilliant magnesium torches suspended from
parachutes so that they would fall slowly and
give a broad illumination, while the airplane itself
was shielded from the light by the parachute.</p>

<p>But these giants were not the only bombing-machines.
There were smaller machines that
operated over the enemy's battle-line and
dropped bombs on any suspicious object behind
the enemy lines. These machines had to be convoyed
by fast battle-planes which fought off
hostile airmen.</p>

<h3>HOW FAST IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES
PER HOUR?</h3>

<p>In naval warfare the battle-ship is the biggest
and heaviest ship of the fleet, but in the
air the battle-planes are the lightest and the
smallest of the lot. They are one-man machines,
as a rule, little fellows, but enormously
speedy. Speed is such an important factor in
aërial warfare that there was a continuous
struggle between the opposing forces to produce
the faster machine. Airplanes were constantly
growing speedier, until a speed of 150<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
miles per hour was not an uncommon rate of
travel. It is hard to imagine such a speed as
that, but we may gain some idea if we consider
a falling object. The observation platform of
the Woolworth Building, in New York, is about
750 feet above the ground. If you should drop
an object from this platform you would start
it on a journey that would grow increasingly
speedy, particularly as it neared the ground.
By the time it had dropped from the sixtieth
story to the fifty-ninth it would have attained a
speed of nearly 20 miles per hour. (We are not
making any allowances for the resistance of the
air and what it would do to check the speed.) As
it passed the fiftieth story it would be traveling
as fast as an express-train, or 60 miles per hour.
It would finally reach the ground with a speed
equal to that of a fast battle-plane&mdash;150 miles
per hour.</p>

<p>The battle-plane was usually fitted with a
single machine-gun that was fixed to the airplane,
so that it was brought to bear on the
target by aiming the entire machine. In this the
plane was something like a submarine, which
must point its bow at its intended victim in order
to aim its torpedo. The operator of the battle-plane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
simply drove his machine at the enemy
and touched a button on his steering-lever to
start his machine-gun going.</p>

<h3>SHOOTING THROUGH THE PROPELLER</h3>

<p>Now, the fleetest machines and the most easily
man&oelig;uvered are those of the tractor type, that
is, the ones which have the propeller in front;
but having the propeller in front is a handicap
for a single-seater machine, for the gun has to
be fired through the propeller and the bullets
are sure to hit the propeller-blades. Nevertheless
the French did fire right through the propeller,
regardless of whether or not the blades
were hit; but at the point where they came in
line with the fire of the gun they were armored
with steel, so that there was no danger of their
being cut by the bullets. It was calculated that
not more than one bullet in eighteen would strike
the propeller-blade and be deflected from its
course, which was a very trifling loss; nevertheless,
it was a loss, and on this account a mechanism
was devised which would time the operations
of the machine-gun so that the shots would
come only when the propeller-blades were clear
of the line of fire.</p>

<p>A cam placed on the propeller-shaft worked
the trigger of the machine-gun. This did not
slow up the fire of the machine-gun. Quite the
contrary. We are apt to think of the fire of the
machine-guns as very rapid, but they usually
fire only about five hundred rounds per minute,
while an airplane propeller will make something
like twelve hundred revolutions per minute.
And so the mechanism was arranged to pull the
trigger only once for every two revolutions of
the propeller.</p>

<h3>FIGHTING AMONG THE CLOUDS</h3>

<p>There was no service of the war that began to
compare with that of the sky fighter. He had
to climb to enormous heights. Air battles took
place at elevations of twenty thousand feet.
The higher the battle-plane could climb, the better,
because the man above had a tremendous
advantage. Clouds were both a haven and a
menace to him. At any moment an enemy plane
might burst out of the clouds upon him. He
had to be ready to go through all the thrilling
tricks of a circus performer so as to dodge the
other fellow and get a commanding position.
If he were getting the worst of it, he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
feign death and let his machine go tumbling and
fluttering down for a thousand feet or so, only
to recover his equilibrium suddenly and dart
away when the enemy was thrown off his guard.
He might escape into some friendly cloud, but
he dared not hide in it very long, lest he get
lost.</p>

<p>It is a peculiar sensation that comes over an
aviator when he is flying through a thick mass
of clouds. He is cut off from the rest of the
world. He can hear nothing but the terrific
roar of his own motor and the hurricane rush
of the wind against his ears. He can see
nothing but the bluish fog of the clouds. He
begins to lose all sense of direction. His compass
appears to swing violently to and fro, when
really it is his machine that is zig-zagging under
his unsteady guidance. The more he tries to
steady it, the worse becomes the swing of the
compass. As he turns he banks his machine
automatically, just as a bicyclist does when
rounding a corner. He does this unconsciously,
and he may get to spinning round and round,
with his machine standing on its side. In some
cases aviators actually emerged from the clouds
with their machines upside down. To be sure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
this was not an alarming position for an experienced
aviator; at the same time, it was not altogether
a safe one. A machine was sometimes
broken by its operator's effort to right it
suddenly. And so while the clouds made handy
shelters, they were not always safe harbors.</p>

<p>To the battle-plane fell the task of clearing
the air of the enemy. If the enemy's battle-planes
were disposed of, his bombing-planes,
his spotters, and his scouts could not operate,
and he would be blind. And so each side tried
to beat out the other with speedier, more powerful,
and more numerous battle-planes. Fast
double-seaters were built with guns mounted so
that they could turn in any direction.</p>

<h3>THE FLYING TANK</h3>

<p>The Germans actually built an armored battle-plane
known as the flying tank. It was a
two-seater intended mainly for attacking infantry
and was provided with two machine-guns
that pointed down through the floor of the
fuselage. A third gun mounted on a revolving
wooden ring could be used to fight off hostile
planes. The bottom and sides of the fuselage
or body of the airplane from the gunner's cockpit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
forward were sheathed with plates of steel
armor. The machine was a rather cumbersome
craft and did not prove very successful. A flying
tank was brought down within the American
lines just before the signing of the armistice.</p>

<h3>AMERICA'S HELP</h3>

<p>Our own contribution to the war in the air
was considerable, but we had hardly started before
the armistice brought the fighting to an
end. Before we entered the war we did not
give the airplane any very serious consideration.
To be sure, we built a large number of
airplanes for the British, but they were not
good enough to be sent to the front; they were
used merely as practice planes in the British
training-schools. We knew that we were hopelessly
outclassed, but we did not care very
much. Then we stepped into the conflict.</p>

<p>"What can we do to help?" we asked our
allies, and their answer gave us a shock.</p>

<p>"Airplanes!" they cried. "Build us airplanes&mdash;thousands
of them&mdash;so that we can
drive the enemy out of the air and blind his
armies!"</p>

<p>It took us a while to recover from our surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
and then we realized why we had been
asked to build airplanes. The reputation of the
United States as a manufacturer of machinery
had spread throughout the world. We Americans
love to take hold of a machine and turn it
out in big quantities. Our allies were sure that
we could turn out first-class airplanes, and many
of them, if we tried.</p>

<p>Congress made an appropriation of six hundred
and forty million dollars for aëronautics,
and then things began to hum.</p>

<h3>A BIRTHDAY PRESENT TO THE NATION</h3>

<p>The heart of an airplane is its engine. We
know a great deal about gasolene-engines, especially
automobile engines; but an airplane engine
is a very different thing. It must be tremendously
powerful, and at the same time extremely
light. Every ounce of unnecessary
weight must be shaved off. It must be built
with the precision of a watch; its vital parts
must be true to a ten-thousandth part of an inch.
It takes a very powerful horse to develop one
horse-power for a considerable length of time.
It would take a hundred horses to supply the
power for even a small airplane, and they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
weigh a hundred and twenty thousand pounds.
An airplane motor of the same power would
weigh less than three hundred pounds, which is
a quarter of the weight of a single horse. It
was this powerful, yet most delicate, machine
that we were called upon to turn out by the thousand.
There was no time to waste; a motor
must be designed that could be built in the
American way, without any tinkering or fussy
hand-work.</p>

<p>Two of our best engineers met in a hotel in
Washington on June 3, 1917, and worked for
five days without once leaving their rooms.
They had before them all the airplane knowledge
of our allies. American engine-builders
offered up their trade secrets. Everything was
done to make this motor worthy of America's
reputation. There was a race to have the motor
finished by the Fourth of July. Sure
enough, on Independence Day the finished motor
was there in Washington&mdash;the "Liberty motor,"
a birthday present to the nation.</p>

<p>Of course that did not mean that we were
ready at once to turn out Liberty motors by the
thousand. The engine had to undergo many
tests and a large number of alterations before it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
was perfectly satisfactory and then special machinery
had to be constructed before it could
be manufactured in quantity. It was Thanksgiving
Day before the first manufactured Liberty
was turned out and even after that change
upon change was made in this little detail and
that. It was not until a year after we went to
war that the engine began to be turned out in
quantity.</p>

<p>There was nothing startlingly new about the
engine. It was a composite of a number of
other engines, but it was designed to be turned
out in enormous quantities, and it was remarkably
efficient. It weighed only 825 pounds and
it developed over 420 horse-power. Some machines
went up as high as 485 horse-power. An
airplane engine weighing less than 2 pounds per
horse-power is wonderfully efficient. Of course
the Liberty was too heavy for a light battle-plane
(a heavy machine, no matter how powerful,
cannot make sharp turns), but it was excellent
for other types of airplanes and large
orders for Liberty engines were made by our
allies. Of course we made other engines as
well, and the planes to carry them. We built
large Caproni and Handley-Page machines, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
we were developing some remarkably swift and
powerful planes of our own when the Germans
thought it about time to stop fighting.</p>

<h3>FLYING BOATS</h3>

<p>So far we have said nothing about the seaplanes
which were used in large numbers to
watch for submarines. These were big flying
boats in which speed was not a very important
matter. One of the really big machines we developed,
but which was not finished until after
the war, was a giant with a 110-foot span and
a body or hull 50 feet long. During the war
seaplanes carried wireless telephone apparatus
with which they could call to destroyers and submarine-chasers
when they spotted a submarine.
They also carried bombs which they could drop
on U-boats, and even heavy guns with which
they could fire shell.</p>

<p>A still later development are the giant planes
of the N.&nbsp;C. type with a wing-spread of 126
feet and driven by four Liberty motors. They
carry a useful load of four and a half tons.</p>

<div class="caption0">The Flying-tank&mdash;an Armored German Airplane designed
for firing on troops on the march</div></div>

<p>Early in the war, large guns were mounted
on airplanes, but the shock of the recoil proved
too much for the airplane to stand. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
an American inventor produced a gun which
had no recoil. This he accomplished by using
a double-end gun, which was fired from the middle.
The bullet or shell was shot out at the
forward end of the gun and a dummy charge
of sand was shot out at the rear end. The sand
spread out and did no damage at a short distance
from the gun, but care had to be taken
not to come too close. These non-recoil guns
were made in different sizes, to fire 1½-inch to
3-inch shell.</p>

<h3>THE AUTOMATIC SEAPLANE</h3>

<p>Another interesting development was the target
airplane used for the training of aërial gunners.
This was a small seaplane with a span
of only 18½ feet, driven by a 12-horse-power
motor, the whole machine weighing but 175
pounds. This was sent up without a pilot and
it would fly at the rate of forty to fifty miles
per hour until its supply of gasolene gave out,
when it would drop down into the sea. It afforded
a real target for gunners in practice
machines.</p>

<div class="caption0">An N-C (Navy-Curtiss) Seaplane of the type that made the first flight across the Atlantic</div></div>

<p>Early in the war an American inventor proposed
that seaplanes be provided with torpedoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
which they could launch at an enemy ship. The
seaplane would swoop down out of the sky to
within a short distance of the ship, drop its projectile,
and fly off again, and the torpedo would
continue on its course until it blew up the vessel.
It was urged that a fleet of such seaplanes protected
by a convoy of fast battle-planes could
invade the enemy harbors and destroys its powerful
fleet. It seemed like a rather wild idea,
but the British actually built such torpedo-planes
and tested them. However, the German
fleet surrendered before it was necessary to
blow it up in such fashion.</p>

<h3>AIRPLANES AFTER THE WAR</h3>

<p>With the war ended, all the Allied powers
have large numbers of airplanes on their hands
and also large numbers of trained aviators.
Undoubtedly airplanes will continue to fill the
skies in Europe and we shall see more and more
of them in this country. Even during the war
they were used for other purposes than fighting.
There were ambulances on wings&mdash;machines
with the top of the fuselage removable so that
a patient on a stretcher could be placed inside.
A French machine was furnished with a complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
hospital equipment for emergency treatment
and even for performing an operation in
case of necessity. The flying hospital could
carry the patient back to the field or base hospital
after treatment.</p>

<p>Mail-carrying airplanes are already an old
story. In Europe the big bombing-machines
are being used for passenger service between
cities. There is an air line between Paris and
London. The airplanes carry from a dozen to
as many as fifty passengers on a single trip. In
some cities here, as well as abroad, the police
are being trained to fly, so that they can police
the heavens when the public takes to wings.
Evidently the flying-era is here.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Ships that Sail the Skies</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Shortly</span> after the Civil War broke out,
Thaddeus S.&nbsp;C. Lowe, an enthusiastic
American aëronaut, conceived the idea of sending
up scout balloons to reconnoiter the position
of the enemy. These balloons were to be
connected by telegraph wires with the ground,
so that they could direct the artillery fire. The
idea was so novel to the military authorities of
that day that it was not received with favor.
Balloons were looked upon as freak inventions,
entirely impracticable for the stern realities
of war; and as for telegraphing from a balloon,
no one had ever done that before.</p>

<div class="caption0">A big German Zeppelin that was forced to come down on French soil</div></div>

<p>But this enthusiast was not to be daunted,
and he made a direct appeal to President Lincoln,
offering to prove the practicability of this
means of scouting. So he took his balloon to
Washington and made an ascent from the
grounds of the Smithsonian Institution, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
the President came out on the lawn south of the
White House to watch the demonstration. In
order to test him, Mr. Lincoln took off his hat,
waved his handkerchief, and made other signals.
Lowe observed each act through his field-glasses
and reported it to the President by telegraph.
Mr. Lincoln was so impressed by the demonstration
that he ordered the army to use the observation
balloon, and so with some reluctance
the gas-bag was introduced into military service,
Professor Lowe being made chief aëronautic
engineer. Under Lowe's direction the observation
balloons played an important part in the
operations of the Union Army.</p>

<div class="caption0">Observation Car lowered from a Zeppelin sailing

<p>On one occasion a young German military
attaché begged the privilege of making an ascent
in the balloon. Permission was given and
when the German officer returned to earth he
was wildly enthusiastic in praise of this aërial
observation post. He had had a splendid view
of the enemy and could watch operations
through his field-glasses which were of utmost
importance. Realizing the military value of
the aircraft, he returned to Germany and urged
military authorities to provide themselves with
captive balloons. This young officer was Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Ferdinand von Zeppelin, who was destined later
to become the most famous aëronautic authority
in the world and who lived to see Germany
equipped with a fleet of balloons which were
self-propelling and could travel over land and
sea to spread German frightfulness into England.
He also lived to see the virtual failure
of this type of war-machine in the recent great
conflict, and it was possibly because of his deep
disappointment at having his huge expensive
airships bested by cheap little airplanes that
Count von Zeppelin died in March, 1917. However,
he was spared the humiliation of seeing a
fleet of Zeppelins lose their way in a fog and
fall into France, one of them being captured before
it could be destroyed, so that all its secrets
of construction were learned by the French.</p>

<h3>THE WEIGHT OF HYDROGEN</h3>

<p>Before we describe the Zeppelin airships and
the means by which they were eventually overcome,
we must know something about the principles
of balloons. Every one knows that balloons
are kept up in the air by means of a very
light gas, but somehow the general public fails
to understand why the gas should hold it up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Some people have a notion that there is something
mysterious about hydrogen gas which
makes it resist the pull of gravity, and that the
more hydrogen you crowd into the balloon the
more weight it will lift. But hydrogen has
weight and feels the pull of gravity just as air
does, or water, or lead. The only reason the
balloon rises is because it weighs less than the
air it displaces. It is hard to think of air
as having weight, but if we weigh air, hydrogen,
coal-gas, or any other gas, in a vacuum, it will
tip the scales just as a solid would. A thousand
cubic feet of air weighs 80 pounds. In other
words, the air in a room ten feet square with a
ceiling ten feet high, weighs just about 80
pounds. The same amount of coal-gas weighed
in a vacuum would register only 40 pounds;
while an equal volume of hydrogen would weigh
only 5½ pounds. But when we speak of volumes
of gas we must remember that gas, unlike
a liquid or a solid, can be compressed or expanded
to almost any dimensions. For instance,
we could easily fill our room with a ton
of air if the walls would stand the pressure; or
we could pump out the air, until there were but
a few ounces of air left. But in one case the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
air would be so highly compressed that it would
exert a pressure of about 375 pounds on every
square inch of the wall of the room, while in
the other case its pressure would be almost infinitesimal.
But 80 pounds of air in a room
of a thousand cubic feet would exert the same
pressure as the atmosphere, or 15 pounds on
every square inch. And when we say that a
thousand cubic feet of hydrogen weighs only a
little over 5 pounds, we are talking about hydrogen
at the same pressure as the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Since the hydrogen is sixteen times lighter
than air, naturally it will float in the air, just as
a piece of wood will float in water because it is
lighter than the same volume of water. If we
surrounded the thousand cubic feet of hydrogen
with a bag so that the gas will not diffuse
into the air and mix with it, we shall have a
balloon which would float in air provided the bag
and the hydrogen it contains do not weigh more
than eighty pounds. As we rise from the surface
of the earth, the air becomes less and less
dense, or, in other words, it becomes lighter,
and the balloon will keep on rising through the
atmosphere until it reaches a point at which its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
weight, gas-bag and all, is exactly the same as
that of an equal volume of air.</p>

<p>But there are many conditions that affect the
height to which the balloon will ascend. The
higher we rise, the colder it is apt to become,
and cold has a tendency to compress the hydrogen,
collapsing the balloon and making it relatively
heavier. When the sun beats upon a balloon,
it heats the hydrogen, expanding it and
making it relatively lighter, and if there is
no room for this expansion to take place in the
bag, the bag will burst. For this reason, a big
safety-valve must be provided and the ordinary
round balloon is open at the bottom so that the
hydrogen can escape when it expands too much
and the balloonist carries ballast in the form of
sand which he can throw over to lighten the
balloon when the gas is contracted by a sudden
draft of cold air.</p>

<p>Although a round balloon carries no engine
and no propeller, it can be guided through the
air to some degree. When an aëronaut wishes
to go in any particular direction, he sends up
his balloon by throwing out ballast or lowers it
by letting out a certain amount of gas, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
he reaches a level at which he finds a breeze
blowing in the desired direction. Such was
the airship of Civil War times, but for military
purposes it was not advisable to use free
balloons, because of the difficulty of controlling
them. They were too liable to fall into the
hands of the enemy. All that was needed was
a high observation post from which the enemy
could be watched, and from which observations
could be reported by telegraph. The balloon
was not looked upon as a fighting-machine.</p>

<h3>ZEPPELIN'S FAILURES AND SUCCESSES</h3>

<p>But Count Zeppelin was a man of vision. He
dreamed of a real ship of the air&mdash;a machine
that would sail wherever the helmsman chose,
regardless of wind and weather. Many years
elapsed before he actually began to work out
his dreams, and then he met with failure after
failure. He believed in big machines and the
loss of one of his airships meant the waste of
a large sum of money, but he persisted, even
though he spent all his fortune, and had to go
heavily in debt. Every one thought him a crank
until he built his third airship and proved its
worth by making a trip of 270 miles. At once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
the German Government was interested and saw
wonderful military possibilities in the new craft.
The Zeppelin was purchased by the government
and money was given the inventor to further his
experiments.</p>

<p>That was not the end of his failures. Before
the war broke out, thirteen Zeppelins had been
destroyed by one accident or another. Evidently
the building of Zeppelin airships was not
a paying undertaking, although they were used
to carry passengers on short aërial voyages.
But the government made up money losses and
Zeppelin went on developing his airships.</p>

<p>Of course, he was not the only one to build
airships, nor even the first to build a dirigible.
The French built some large dirigibles, but
they failed to see any great military advantage
in ships that could sail through the air, particularly
after the airplane was invented, and
so it happened that when the war started the
French were devoting virtually all their energies
to the construction of speedy, powerful
airplanes. As for the British, they did not pay
much attention to airships. The idea that their
isles might be attacked from the sky seemed an
exceedingly remote possibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<h3>RIGID, SEMI-RIGID, AND FLEXIBLE BALLOONS</h3>

<p>Count Zeppelin always held that the dirigible
balloons must be rigid, so that they could be
driven through the air readily and would hold
their shape despite variations in the pressure of
the hydrogen. The French, on the other hand,
used a semi-rigid airship; that is, one in which a
flexible balloon is attached to a rigid keel or
body. The British clung to the idea of an entirely
flexible balloon and they suspended their
car from the gas-bag without any rigid framework
to hold the gas-bag in shape. In every
case, the balloons were kept taut or distended
by means of air-bags or ballonets. These air-bags
were placed inside the gas-bags and as the
hydrogen expanded it would force the air out
through valves, but the hydrogen itself would
not escape. When the hydrogen contracted, the
air-bags were pumped full of air so as to maintain
the balloon in its fully distended condition.
Additional supplies of compressed hydrogen
were kept in metal tanks.</p>

<div class="caption0">One of the engine cars or "power eggs" of a British Dirigible</div></div>

<p>In the Zeppelin balloon, however, the gas was
contained in separate bags which were placed in
a framework of aluminum covered over with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
fabric. Count Zeppelin did not believe in placing
all his eggs in one basket. If one of these
balloons burst or was injured in any way, there
was enough buoyancy in the rest of the gas-bags
to hold up the airship. As the Zeppelins were
enormous structures, the framework had to be
made strong and light, and it was built up of a
latticework of aluminum alloy. Aluminum itself
was not strong enough for the purpose, but
a mixture of aluminum and zinc and later another
alloy known as duralumin, consisting of
aluminum with three per cent of copper and
one per cent of nickel, provided a very rigid
framework that was exceedingly light. Duralumin
is four or five times as strong as aluminum
and yet weighs but little more.</p>

<div class="caption0">Crew of the C-5 (American Coastal Dirigible) starting for Newfoundland
to make a Transatlantic Flight</div></div>

<p>The body of the Zeppelin is not a perfect circle
in section, but is made up in the form of a
polygon with sixteen sides, and the largest of the
Zeppelins used during the war contained sixteen
compartments, in each of which was placed a
large hydrogen gas-bag. A super-Zeppelin, as
the latest type is called, was about seventy-five
feet in diameter and seven hundred and sixty
feet long, or almost as long as three New
York street blocks. In its gas-bags it carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
two million cubic feet of hydrogen and although
the whole machine with its fuel, stores, and passengers
weighed close to fifty tons, it was so
much lighter than the air it displaced that it
had a reserve buoyancy of over ten tons.</p>

<h3>KEEPING ENGINES CLEAR OF THE INFLAMMABLE
HYDROGEN</h3>

<p>As hydrogen is a very inflammable gas, it is
extremely dangerous to have an internal-combustion
engine operating very near the gas-bags.
In the super-Zeppelins the engines were
placed in four cars suspended from the balloon.
There was one of these cars forward, and one
at the stern, while near the center were two cars
side by side. In the rear car there were two
engines, either of which could be used to drive
the propeller. By means of large steering rudders
and horizontal rudders, the machine could
be forced to dive or rise or turn in either direction
laterally. The pilot of the Zeppelin had
an elaborate operating-compartment from
which he could control the rudders, and he also
had control of the valves in the ballonets so that
by the touch of a button he could regulate the
pressure of gas in any part of the dirigible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
There were nineteen men in the crew of the
Zeppelin&mdash;two in the operating-compartment,
and two in each of the cars containing engines,
except for the one at the stern in which there
were three men. The other men were placed
in what was known as the "cat walk" or passageway
running inside the framework under
the gas-bags. These men were given various
tasks and were supposed to get as much sleep
as they could, so as to be ready to replace the
other men at need.</p>

<p>The engine cars at each side of the balloon
were known as power eggs because of their general
egg shape. At the center of the Zeppelin
the bombs were stored, and there were electro-magnetic
releasing-devices operated from the
pilot's room by which the pilot could drop the
bombs whenever he chose. The Zeppelin also
carried machine-guns to fight off airplanes.
Gasolene was stored in tanks which were placed
in various parts of the machine, any one of
which could feed one or all of the engines, and
they were so arranged that they could be thrown
overboard when the gasolene was used up, so
as to lighten the load of the Zeppelin. Water
ballast was used instead of sand, and alcohol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
was mixed with the water to keep it from freezing.
The machine which came down in French
territory and was captured before it could be
destroyed by the pilot, found itself unable to
rise because in the intense cold of the upper
air the water ballast had frozen, and it could
not be let out to lighten the load of the Zeppelin.</p>

<h3>THE ZEPPELIN'S TINY ANTAGONISTS</h3>

<p>The one thing above all others that the Zeppelin
commander feared was the attack of airplanes.
In the early stages of the war, it was
considered unsafe for airplanes to fly by night
because of the difficulty of making a landing in
the dark. Later this difficulty was overcome by
the use of search-lights at the landing-fields.
The airplane would signal its desire to land and
the search-lights would point out the proper
landing-field for it. So that after the first few
months of the war Zeppelins were subjected to
the danger of airplane attack. Of course, on a
dark night it was very difficult for an airplane
to locate a Zeppelin, because the huge machine
could not be seen and the throb of its engines
was drowned out by the engines of the airplane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
itself. Nevertheless, Zeppelins were occasionally
located and destroyed by airplanes.</p>

<p>The danger of the Zeppelin lay in the fact
that it was supported by an enormous volume
of very inflammable gas and the airplane needed
but to set fire to this gas to cause the destruction
of the giant of the air. And so the machine-guns
carried by airplanes were provided
with explosive, flaming bullets. A burst of
flame within the gas-bag would not set the gas
on fire, because there would be no air inside
to feed the fire, but surrounding the gas-bag
there was always a certain leakage of hydrogen
which would mix with the air in the compartment
and this would produce an explosive
mixture which needed but the touch of fire to
set it off. The Zeppelin was provided with a
ventilating-system to carry off these explosive
gases, but they could never be disposed of very
effectively, and, as a consequence, a number of
Zeppelins were destroyed by the tiny antagonists
that were sent up by the British and the
French. To fight off these assailants the Germans
provided their Zeppelins with guns which
would fire shrapnel shell. It is difficult for a
Zeppelin to use machine-guns against an airplane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
because the latter would merely climb
above the Zeppelin and would be shielded by
the balloon itself. And so the Germans put a
gun emplacement on top of the balloon both
forward and aft. There was a deck extending
along the top of the balloon which was reached
by a ladder running up through the center of
the airship. But it was impossible to ward off
the fleet little antagonists, once the dirigible was
discovered. True, a Zeppelin could make as
much as seventy miles per hour, but the fastest
airplanes could travel twice as fast as that.</p>

<h3>SUSPENDING AN OBSERVER BELOW THE ZEPPELIN</h3>

<p>One ingenious scheme that was tried was to
suspend an observation car under the Zeppelin.
The car was about fourteen feet long and five
feet in diameter, fitted with a tail to keep it
headed in the direction it was towed. It had
glass windows forward and there was plenty of
room in it for a man to lie at full length and
make observations of things below. The car
with its observer could be lowered a few thousand
feet below the Zeppelin, so that the observer
could watch proceedings below, while the
airship remained hidden among the clouds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
The observer was connected by telephone with
the chart-room of the Zeppelin and could report
his discoveries or even act as a pilot to direct
the course of the ship.</p>

<p>But despite everything that could be done,
the Zeppelin eventually proved a failure as a
war-vessel because it was so very costly to construct
and operate and could so easily be destroyed,
and the Germans began to build huge
airplanes with which bombing-raids could be
continued.</p>

<p>Strange to say, however, although the Germans
were ready to admit the failure of their
big airship, when the war stopped the Allies
were actually building machines patterned after
the Zeppelin, but even larger, and expected to
use them for bombing-excursions over Germany.
This astonishing turn of the tables was
due to the fact that America had made a contribution
to aëronautics that solved the one
chief drawback of the Zeppelin.</p>

<h3>A BALLOON GAS THAT WILL NOT BURN</h3>

<p>When we entered the war against Germany,
our allies placed before us all their problems
and among them was this one of the highly inflammable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
airship. Could we not furnish a substitute
for hydrogen that would not burn? It
was suggested to us that helium would do if we
could produce that gas cheaply and in sufficient
quantity. Now, helium has a history of its own
that is exceedingly interesting.</p>

<p>Every now and then the moon bobs its head
into our light and we have a solar eclipse. But
our satellite is not big enough to cut off all
the light of the big luminary and the fiery atmosphere
of the sun shows us a brilliant halo
all around the black disk of the moon. Long
ago, astronomers analyzed this flaming atmosphere
with the spectroscope, and by the different
bands of light that appeared they were able
to determine what gases were present in the
sun's atmosphere. But there was one band of
bright yellow which they could not identify.
Evidently this was produced by a gas unknown
on earth, and they called it "helium" or "sun"
gas.</p>

<p>For a quarter of a century this sun gas remained
a mystery; then one day, in 1895, Sir
William Ramsay discovered the same band of
light when studying the spectrum of the mineral
cleveite. The fact that astronomers had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
able to single out an element on the sun ninety
million miles away before our chemists could
find it right here on earth, produced a mild sensation,
but the general public attached no special
importance to the gas itself. It proved
to be a very light substance, next to hydrogen
the lightest of gases, and for years it resisted
all attempts at liquefaction. Only when Onnes,
the Dutch scientist, succeeded in getting it down
to a temperature of 450 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit,
did the gas yield to the chill and condense
into a liquid. The gas would not burn;
it would not combine with any other elements,
and apparently it had no use on earth, and it
might have remained indefinitely a lazy member
of the chemical fraternity had not the great
world conflict stirred us into frenzied activity
in all branches of science in our effort to beat
the Hun.</p>

<p>Because the gas had no commercial value,
there was only a small amount of helium to be
found in the whole world. Not a single laboratory
in the United States had more than five
cubic feet of it and its price ranged from
$1,500 to $6,000 per cubic foot. At the lowest
price it would cost $3,000,000,000 to provide gas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
enough for one airship of Zeppelin dimensions
and it seemed absurd even to think of a helium
airship.</p>

<h3>AMERICAN CHEMISTS TO THE RESCUE</h3>

<p>Just before the war it was discovered that
there is a considerable amount of helium in the
natural gas of Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas,
and Sir William Ramsey suggested that our
chemists might study some method of getting
helium from this source. The only way of separating
it out was to liquefy the gases by subjecting
them to extreme cold. All gases turn
to liquid if they are cooled sufficiently, and then
further cold will freeze them solid. But helium
can stand more cold than any other and this
fact gave the clue to its recovery from natural
gas. The latter was frozen and one after
another the different elements condensed into
liquid, until finally only helium was left.
This sounds simple, but it is a difficult matter
to get such low temperature as that on a
large scale and do it economically. To be of
any real service in aëronautics helium would
have to be reduced in cost from fifteen hundred
dollars to less than ten cents per cubic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
foot. Several different kinds of refrigerating-machinery
were tried and finally just before the
war was brought to a close by the armistice we
had succeeded in producing helium at the rate
of eight cents per cubic foot, with the prospect
of reducing its cost still further. A large plant
for recovering helium was being built. The
plant will have been completed before this book
is published, and it will be turning out helium
for peaceful instead of military airships.</p>

<p>The reduction in the cost of helium is really
one of the most important developments of this
war. By removing the fire risk from airships
we can safely use these craft for aërial cruises
or for quick long-distance travel over land and
sea. For, even in time of peace, sailing under
millions of cubic feet of hydrogen is a serious
matter. Although no incendiary bullets are to
be feared, there is always the danger of setting
fire to the gas within the exhaust of the engines.
Engines have had to be hung in cars well below
the balloon proper. But with helium in the gas-bags
the engines can be placed inside the balloon
envelop and the propellers can operate on
the center line of the car.</p>

<p>In the case of one Zeppelin, the hydrogen was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
set on fire by an electric spark produced by friction
on the fabric of one of the gas-bags, and so
even with the engine exhausts properly screened
there is danger. The helium airship, however,
would be perfectly safe from fire and passengers
could smoke on deck or in their cabins
within the balloon itself without any more fear
of fire than they would have on shipboard.
Wonderful possibilities have been opened by the
production of helium on a large and economical
scale, and the airship seems destined to play
an important part in transportation very soon.
As this book is going to press, we learn of enormous
dirigibles about to be built in England for
passenger service, which will have half again as
great a lifting-power as the largest Zeppelins.
The final chapter of the story of dirigibles is yet
to be written, but in concluding this chapter it
is interesting to note that the world's greatest
aëronautic expert got his first inspiration from
America and finally that America has now furnished
the one element which was lacking to
make the dirigible balloon a real success.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Getting the Range</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Every</span> person with a good pair of eyes in
his head is a range-finder. He may not
know it, but he is, just the same, and the way to
prove it is to try a little range-finding on a small
scale.</p>

<p>Use the top of a table for your field of operations,
and pick out some spot within easy reach
of your hand for the target whose range you
wish to find. The target may be a penny or a
small circle drawn on a piece of white paper.
Take a pencil in your hand and imagine it is
a shell which you are going to land on the
target. It is not quite fair to have a bird's-eye
view of the field, so get down on your knees and
bring your eyes within a few inches of the top
of the table. Now close one eye and making
your hand describe an arc through the air, like
the arc that a shell would describe, see how
nearly you can bring the pencil-point down on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
the center of the target. Do it slowly, so that
your eye may guide the hand throughout its
course. You will be surprised to find out how
far you come short, or overreach the mark.
You will have actually to grope for the target.
If by any chance you should score a hit on the
first try, you may be sure that it is an accident.</p>

<p>Have a friend move the target around to a
different position, and try again. Evidently,
with one eye you are not a good range-finder;
but now use two eyes and you will score a hit
every time. Not only can you land the pencil
on the penny, but you will be able to bring it
down on the very center of the target.</p>

<p>The explanation of this is that when you
bring your eyes to bear upon any object that
is near by, they have to be turned in slightly, so
that both of them shall be aimed directly at
that object. The nearer the object, the more
they are turned in, and the farther the object,
the more nearly parallel are the eyes. Long
experience has taught you to gage the distance
of an object by the feel of the eyes&mdash;that is, by
the effort your muscles have to make to pull
the eyes to a focus&mdash;and in this way the eyes
give you the range of an object. You do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
know what the distance is in feet or inches, but
you can tell when the pencil-point has moved
out until it is at the same focus as the target.</p>

<p>The experiment can be tried on a larger scale
with the end of a fishing-rod, but here you will
probably have to use a larger target. However,
there is a limit to which you can gage the range.
At a distance of, say, fifteen or twenty feet, a
variation of a few inches beyond or this side
of the target makes scarcely any change in the
focus of the eyes. That is because the eyes are
so close together. If they were farther apart,
they could tell the range at much greater distances.</p>

<h3>SPREADING THE EYES FAR APART</h3>

<p>Now the ordinary range-finder, used in the
army and in the navy, is an arrangement for
spreading the eyes apart to a considerable distance.
Of course the eyes are not actually
spread, but their vision is. The range-finder is
really a double telescope. The barrel is not
pointed at an object, but it is held at right angles
to it. You look into the instrument at the middle
of the barrel and out of it at the two ends.
A system of mirrors or prisms makes this possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
The range-finder may be a yard or more
in length, which is equivalent to spreading your
eyes a yard or more apart. Now, the prisms or
object-glasses at the ends of the tube are adjustable,
so that they will turn in until they
focus directly on the target whose range you
wish to find, and the angle through which these
glasses are turned gives a measure of the distance
of the target. The whole thing is calculated
out so that the distance in feet, yards,
or meters, or whatever the measure may be, is
registered on a scale in the range-finder. Ordinarily
only one eye is used to look through the
range-finder, because the system of mirrors is
set to divide the sight of that one eye and make
it serve the purposes of two. That leaves the
other eye free to read the scale, which comes
automatically into view as the range-finder is
adjusted for the different ranges.</p>

<p>On the battle-ships enormous range-finders
are used. Some of them are twenty feet long.
With the eyes spread as far apart as that and
with a microscope to read the scale, you can
imagine how accurately the range can be found,
even when the target is miles away. But on
land such big range-finders cannot conveniently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
be used; they are too bulky. When it is necessary
to get the range of a very distant object,
two observers are used who are stationed several
hundred yards apart. These observers
have telescopes which they bear upon the object,
and the angle through which they have to
turn the telescope is reported by telephone to
the battery, where, by a rapid calculation, it is
possible to estimate the exact position of the
target. Then the gun is moved up or down, to
the right or to the left, according to the calculation.
The observers have to creep as near
to the enemy as possible and they must be up
high enough to command a good view of the
target. Sometimes they are placed on top of
telegraph poles or hidden up a tall tree, or in
a church steeple.</p>

<h3>GETTING THE OBSERVER OFF THE GROUND</h3>

<p>This was the method of getting the range in
previous wars and it was used to a considerable
extent in the war we have just been through.
But the great European conflict brought out
wonderful improvements in all branches of
fighting; and range-finding was absolutely revolutionized,
because shelling was done at greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
ranges than ever before, but chiefly because the
war was carried up into the sky.</p>

<p>A bird's-eye observation is much more accurate
than any that can be obtained from the
ground. Even before this war, some observations
were taken by sending a man up in a kite,
particularly a kite towed from a ship, and even
as far back as the Civil War captive balloons
were used to raise an observer to a good height
above the ground. They were the ordinary
round balloons, but the observation balloon of
to-day is a very different-looking object. It is
a sausage-shaped gas-bag that is held on a slant
to the wind like a kite, so that the wind helps
to hold it up. To keep it head-on to the wind,
there is a big air-bag that curls around the
lower end of the sausage. This acts like a rudder,
and steadies the balloon. Some balloons
have a tail consisting of a series of cone-shaped
cups strung on a cable. A kite balloon will ride
steadily in a wind that would dash a common
round balloon in all directions. Observers in
these kite balloons are provided with telephone
instruments by which they can communicate instantly
with the battery whose fire they are directing.
But a kite balloon is a helpless object;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
it cannot fight the enemy. The hydrogen gas
that holds it up will burn furiously if set on
fire. In the war an enemy airplane had merely
to drop a bomb upon it or fire an incendiary bullet
into it, and the balloon would go up in smoke.
Nothing could save it, once it took fire, and all
the observers could do was to jump for their
lives as soon as they saw the enemy close by.
They always had parachutes strapped to them,
so they could leap without an instant's delay in
case of sudden danger. At the very first approach
of an enemy airplane, the kite balloon
had to be hauled down or it would surely be destroyed,
and so kite balloons were not very dependable
observation stations for the side
which did not control the air.</p>

<p>As stated in the preceding chapter, just before
the fighting came to an end, our army was
preparing to use balloons that were not afraid
of flaming bullets, because they were to be filled
with a gas that would not burn.</p>

<h3>MAKING MAPS WITH A CAMERA</h3>

<p>Because airplanes filled the sky with eyes,
everything that the army did near the front
had to be carefully hidden from the winged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
scouts. Batteries were concealed in the woods,
or under canopies where the woods were shot
to pieces, or they were placed in dugouts so that
they could not be located. Such targets could
seldom be found with a kite balloon. It was
the task of airplane observers to search out
these hidden batteries. The eye alone was not
depended upon to find them. Large cameras
were used with telescopic lenses which would
bring the surface of the earth near while the
airplane flew at a safe height. These were
often motion-picture cameras which would automatically
make an exposure every second, or
every few seconds.</p>

  <div class="captionl">(C) Underwood &amp; Underwood</div>

<div class="caption0">British Anti-aircraft Section getting the Range of an Enemy Aviator</div></div>

<p>When the machine returned from a photographing-expedition,
the films were developed
and printed, and then pieced together to form a
photographic map. The map was scrutinized
very carefully for any evidence of a hidden battery
or for any suspicious enemy object. As
the enemy was always careful to disguise its
work, the camera had to be fitted with color-screens
which would enable it to pick out details
that would not be evident to the eye. As
new photographic maps were made from day to
day, they were carefully compared one with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
the other so that it might be seen if there was the
slightest change in them which would indicate
some enemy activity. As soon as a suspicious
spot was discovered, its position was noted on
a large-scale military map and the guns were
trained upon it.</p>

<h3>CORRECTING THE AIM</h3>

<p>It is one thing to know where the target is and
another to get the shell to drop upon it. In the
firing of a shell a distance of ten or twenty miles,
the slightest variation in the gun will make a
difference of many yards in the point where the
shell lands. Not only that, but the direction of
the wind and the density of the air have a part
to play in the journey of the shell. If the shell
traveled through a vacuum, it would be a much
simpler matter to score a hit by the map alone.
But even then there would be some differences,
because a gun has to be "warmed up" before it
will fire according to calculation. That is why
it is necessary to have observers, or "spotters"
as they are called, to see where the shell actually
do land and tell the gun-pointers whether
to elevate or depress the gun, and how much to
"traverse" it&mdash;that is, move it sideways. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
would not be a very difficult matter if there
were only one gun firing, but when a large number
of guns are being used, as was almost invariably
the case in the war, the spotter had to
know which shell belonged to the gun he was
directing.</p>

<p>One of the most important inventions of the
war was the wireless telephone, which airplanes
used and which were brought to such perfection
that the pilot of an airplane could talk to a
station on the earth without any difficulty,
from a distance of ten miles; and in some
cases he could reach a range of fifty miles.
With the wireless telephone, the observer could
communicate instantly with the gun-pointer,
and tell him when to fire. Usually thirty seconds
were allowed after the signal sent by the
observer before the gun was fired, and on the instant
of firing, a signal was sent to the man in
the airplane to be on the lookout for the shell.
Knowing the position of the target, the gun-pointer
would know how long it would take the
shell to travel through the air, and he would
keep the man in the airplane posted, warning
him at ten seconds, five seconds, and so forth,
before the shell was due to land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
In order to keep the eyes fresh for observation
and not to have them distracted by other sights,
the observer usually gazed into space until just
before the instant the shell was to land. Then
he would look for the column of smoke produced
by the explosion of the shell and report
back to the battery how far wide of the mark
the shell had landed. A number of shell would
be fired at regular intervals, say four or five per
minute, so that the observer would know which
shell belonged to the gun in question.</p>

<p>There are different kinds of shell. Some
will explode on the instant of contact with the
earth. These are meant to spread destruction
over the surface. There are other shell which
will explode a little more slowly and these penetrate
the ground to some extent before going off;
while a third type has a delayed action and is
intended to be buried deep in the ground before
exploding, so as to destroy dugouts and underground
positions. The bursts of smoke from
the delayed-action shell and the semi-delayed-action
shell rise in a slender vertical column and
are not so easily seen from the sky. The instantaneous
shell, however, produces a broad burst
of smoke which can be spotted much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
readily, and this enables the man in the airplane
to determine the position of the shell with
greater accuracy. For this reason, instantaneous
shell were usually used for spotting-purposes,
and after the gun had found its target,
other shell were used suited to the character of
the work that was to be done.</p>

<h3>MINIATURE BATTLE-FIELDS</h3>

<p>Observation of shell-fire from an airplane
called for a great deal of experience, and our
spotters were given training on a miniature
scale before they undertook to do spotting from
the air. A scaffolding was erected in the training-quarters
over a large picture of a typical bit
of enemy territory. Men were posted at the
top of this scaffolding so that they could get a
bird's-eye view of the territory represented on
the map, and they were connected by telephone
or telegraph with men below who represented
the batteries. The instructor would flash a little
electric light here and there on the miniature
battle-field, and the observers had to locate these
flashes and tell instantly how far they were
from certain targets. This taught them to be
keen and quick and to judge distance accurately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Airplane observing was difficult and dangerous,
and often impossible. On cloudy days the observer
might be unable to fly at a safe height
without being lost in the clouds. Then dependence
had to be placed upon observers stationed
at vantage-points near the enemy, or in kite
balloons.</p>

<h3>SPOTTING BY SOUND</h3>

<p>When there is no way of seeing the work of
a gun, it is still possible to correct the aim, because
the shell can be made to do its own spotting.
Every time a shell lands, it immediately
announces the fact with a loud report. That
report is really a message which the shell sends
out in all directions with a speed of nearly 800
miles per hour&mdash;1,142 feet per second, to be
exact. This sound-message is picked up by a
recorder at several different receiving-stations.
Of course it reaches the nearest station a fraction
of a second before it arrives at the next
nearest one. The distance of each station from
the target is known by careful measurement on
the map, and the time it takes for sound to
travel from the target to each station is accurately
worked out. If the sound arrives at each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
station on schedule time, the shell has scored a
hit; but if it reaches one station a trifle ahead
of time and lags behind at another, that is evidence
that the shell has missed the target and a
careful measure of the distance in time shows
how far and in what direction it is wide of the
mark. In this way it was possible to come
within fifty or even twenty-five yards of the
target.</p>

<p>This sound-method was also used to locate
an enemy battery. It was often well nigh impossible
to locate a battery in any other way.
With the use of smokeless powder, there is
nothing to betray the position of the gun, except
the flash at the instant of discharge, and
even the flash was hidden by screens from the
view of an airplane. Aside from this, when an
airplane came near enough actually to see one
of these guns, the gun would stop firing until the
airplane had been driven off. But a big gun
has a big voice, and it is impossible to silence
it. Often a gun whose position has remained
a secret for a long time was discovered because
the gun itself "peached."</p>

<p>The main trouble with sound-spotting was
that there were usually so many shell and guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
going off at the same time that it was difficult
if not impossible to distinguish one from another.
Sometimes the voice of a hidden gun
was purposely drowned by the noise of a lot of
other guns. After all, the main responsibility
for good shooting had to fall on observers who
could actually see the target, and when we think
of the splendid work of our soldiers in the war,
we must not forget to give full credit to the
tireless men whose duty it was to watch, to
the men on wings who dared the fierce battle-planes
of the enemy, to the men afloat high in

from under a blazing mass of hydrogen, and
finally to the men who crept out to perilous
vantage-points at risk of instant death, in order
to make the fire of their batteries tell.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> one field of war invention the United States
held almost a monopoly and the progress
Americans achieved was epoch-making.</p>

<p>Before the war, an aviator when on the wing
was both deaf and dumb. He could communicate
with other airplanes or with the ground
only by signal or, for short distances, by radiotelegraphy,
but he could not even carry on
conversation with a fellow passenger in the
machine without a speaking-tube fitted to mouth
and ears so as to cut out the terrific roar of
his own engine. Now the range of his voice
has been so extended that he can chat with fellow
aviators miles away. This remarkable
achievement and many others in the field of
radio-communication hinge upon a delicate electrical
device invented by Deforest in 1906 and
known as the "audion." For years this instrument
was used by radiotelegraphers without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
a real appreciation of its marvelous possibilities,
and, as a matter of fact, in its earlier
crude form it was not capable of performing the
wonders it has achieved since it was taken over
and developed by the engineers of the Bell Telephone
System.</p>

<h3>THE AUDION</h3>

<p>Although the audion is familiar to all amateur
radio-operators, we shall have to give a
brief outline of its construction and operation
for the benefit of those who have not had the
opportunity to dabble in wireless telegraphy.</p>

<p>The audion is a small glass bulb from which
the air is exhausted to a high degree of vacuum.
The bulb contains three elements. One is a
tiny filament which is heated to incandescence
by a battery, so that it emits negatively charged
electrons. The filament is at one side of the
bulb and at the opposite side there is a metal
plate. When the plate and the filament are
connected with opposite poles of a battery, there
is a flow of current between them, but because
only negative electrons are emitted by the
filament, the current will flow only in one direction&mdash;that
is, from the plate to the filament.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
If the audion be placed in the circuit of an alternating-current
generator, it will let through
only the current running in one direction.
Thus it will "rectify" the current or convert
alternating current into direct current.</p>

<p>But the most important part of the audion, the
part for which Deforest is responsible, is the
third element, which is a grid or flat coil of
platinum wire placed between the filament and
the plate. This grid furnishes a very delicate
control of the strength of the electric current
between plate and filament. The slightest
change in electric power in the grid will produce
large changes of power in the current
flowing through the audion. This makes it
possible to magnify or amplify very feeble electric
waves, and the extent to which the amplifying
can be carried is virtually limitless, because
a series of audions can be used, the current
passing through the first being connected
with the grid of the next, and so on.</p>

<h3>TALKING FROM NEW YORK TO SAN FRANCISCO</h3>

<p>There is a limit to which telephone conversations
can be carried on over a wire, unless there
is some way of adding fresh energy along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
line. For years all sorts of experiments were
tried with mechanical devices which would receive
a telephone message and send it on with
a fresh relay of current. But these devices distorted
the message so that it was unintelligible.
The range of wire telephony was greatly increased
by the use of certain coils invented by
Pupin, which were placed in the line at intervals;
but still there was a limit to which conversation
could be carried on by wire and it
looked as if it would never be possible to telephone
from one end of this big country of ours
to the other. But the audion supplied a
wonderfully efficient relay and one day we
awoke to hear San Francisco calling, "Hello,"
to New York.</p>

<p>Used as a relay, the improved audion made it
possible to pick up very faint wireless-telegraph
messages and in that way increased the
range of radio outfits. Messages could be received
from great distances without any extensive
or elaborate aërials, and the audion could
be used at the sending-station to magnify the
signals transmitted and send them forth with
far greater power.</p>

<p>Having improved the audion and used it successfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
for long-distance telephone conversation
over wires, the telephone company began
to experiment with wireless telephony. They
believed that it might be possible to use radiotelephony
in places where wires could not be
laid. For instance, it might be possible to talk
across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>But before we go farther, just a word of explanation
concerning radiotelegraphy and radiotelephony
for the benefit of those who have
not even an elementary knowledge of the
subject.</p>

<h3>SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF RADIOTELEGRAPHY</h3>

<p>Suppose we should set up two stakes in a pond
of water, at some distance from each other, and
around each we set a ring-shaped cork float. If
we should move one of these floats up and down
on its stake, it would produce ripples in the
water which would spread out in all directions
and finally would reach the opposite stake and
cause the float there to bob up and down in
exactly the same way as did the float moved
by hand. In wireless telegraphy the two stakes
are represented by antennæ or aërials and the
cork floats are electric charges which are sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
oscillating up and down the antennæ. The oscillations
produced at one aërial will set up
electro-magnetic waves which will spread out
in all directions in the ether until they reach a
receiving-aërial, and there they will produce
electric oscillations similar to the ones at the
transmitting-antenna.</p>

<p>Telegraph signals are sent by the breaking
up of the oscillations at the transmitting-station
into long and short trains of oscillations corresponding
to the dots and dashes of ordinary
wire telegraphy. In other words, while the
sending-key is held down for a dash, there will
be a long series of oscillations in the antenna,
and for the dot a short series, and these short
and long trains of waves will spread out to the
receiving-aërial where they will reproduce the
same series of oscillations. But only a small
part of the energy will act on the receiving-aërial
because the waves like those on the pond
spread in all directions and grow rapidly
weaker. Hence the advantage of an extremely
delicate instrument like the audion to amplify
the signals received.</p>

<p>The oscillations used in wireless telegraphy
these days are very rapid, usually entirely too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
rapid, to affect an ordinary telephone receiver,
and if they did they would produce a note of
such high pitch that it could not be heard. So
it is customary to interrupt the oscillations,
breaking them up into short trains of waves,
and these successive trains produce a note of
low enough pitch to be heard in the telephone
receiver. Of course the interruptions are of
such high frequency that in the sending of a dot-and-dash
message each dot is made up of a great
many of the short trains of waves.</p>

<p>Now in radiotelephony it is not necessary to
break up the oscillations, but they are allowed to
run continuously at very high speed and act as
carriers for other waves produced by speaking
into the transmitter; that is, a single speech-wave
would be made up of a large number
of smaller waves. To make wireless telephony
a success it was necessary to find some
way of making perfectly uniform carrier-waves,
and then of loading on them waves of speech.
Of course, the latter are not sound-waves, because
they are not waves of air, but they are
electro-magnetic waves corresponding exactly
to the sound-waves of air and at the receiving-end
they affect the telephone receiver in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
same way that it is affected by the electric
waves which are sent over telephone wires. The
telephone engineers found that the audion
could be used to regulate the carrier-waves and
also to superpose the speech-waves upon them,
and at the receiving-station the audion was used
to pick up these waves, no matter how feeble
they might be, and amplify them so that they
could be heard in a telephone receiver.</p>

<h3>TALKING WITHOUT WIRES</h3>

<p>Attempts at long-distance talking without
wires were made from Montauk Point, on the
tip of Long Island, to Wilmington, Delaware,
and they were successful. This was in 1915.
The apparatus was still further improved and
then the experiment was tried of talking from
the big Arlington station near Washington to
Darien, on the Isthmus of Panama. This was
a distance of twenty-one hundred miles, and
speech was actually transmitted through space
over that great distance. That having proved
successful, the next attempt was to talk from
Arlington to Mare Island and San Diego, on the
Pacific Coast, a distance of over twenty-five
hundred miles. This proved a success, too, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
it was found possible even to talk as far as
Honolulu.</p>

<div class="caption0">Carrying on Conversation by Radio with an Aviator
Miles Away</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>The engineers now felt confident that they
could talk across the Atlantic to Europe, and
so in October of 1915 arrangements were made
to conduct experiments between Arlington and
the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Although the war
was at its height, and the French were straining
every effort to hold back the Germans at
that time, and although there were constant demands
for the use of radiotelegraphy, the
French showed such an appreciation of science
that they were willing to lend their aid to these
experiments. The Eiffel Tower could be used
only for short periods of time, and there was
much interference from other high-powered
stations. Nevertheless, the experiment proved
perfectly successful, and conversation was carried
on between our capital and that of France,
a distance of thirty-six hundred miles. At the
same time, an operator in Honolulu, forty-five
hundred miles away, heard the messages, and
so the voice at Arlington carried virtually one
third of the way around the globe. After that
achievement, there was a lull in the wireless-telephone
experiments because of the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
But there soon came an opportunity to make
very practical use of all the experimental work.
As soon as there seemed to be a possibility that
we might be drawn into the war, the Secretary
of the Navy asked for the design of apparatus
that would make it possible for ships to converse
with one another and with shore stations. Of
course all vessels are equipped with wireless-telegraph
apparatus, but there is a decided advantage
in having the captain of one ship talk
directly with the captain of another ship, or
take his orders from headquarters, with an
ordinary telephone receiver and transmitter.
A special equipment was designed for battle-ships
and on test it was found that ships could
easily converse with one another over a distance
of thirty-five miles and to shore stations from
a distance of a hundred and seventy-five miles.
The apparatus was so improved that nine conversations
could be carried on at the same time
without any interference of one by the others.</p>

<div class="caption0">Long Distance Radio Apparatus at the Arlington (Va.) Station, with enlarged view of the
Type of Vacuum Tube used</div></div>

<p>When it became certain that we should have
to enter the war, there came a call for radiotelephone
apparatus for submarine-chasers, and
work was started on small, compact outfits for
these little vessels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<h3>RADIOTELEPHONES FOR AIRPLANES</h3>

<p>Then there was a demand for radiotelephone
apparatus to be used on airplanes. This was a
much more complicated matter and called for a
great deal of study. The way in which problem
after problem arose and was solved makes an
exceedingly interesting narrative. It seemed
almost absurd to think that a delicate radiotelegraph
apparatus could be made to work in
the terrific noise and jarring of an airplane.
The first task was to make the apparatus noise-proof.
A special sound-proof room was constructed
in which a noise was produced exactly
imitating that of the engine exhaust of an airplane
engine. In this room, various helmets
were tried in order to see whether they would
be proof against the noise, and finally a very
suitable helmet was designed, in which the telephone
receiver and transmitter were installed.</p>

<p>By summer-time the work had proceeded so
far that an airplane equipped with transmitting-apparatus
could send spoken messages to an
operator on the ground from a distance of two
miles. The antenna of the airplane consisted
of a wire with a weight on the lower end, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
hung down about one hundred yards from the
body of the machine. But a trailing antenna
was a nuisance in airplane man&oelig;uvers, and it
was also found that the helmet which was so
satisfactory in the laboratory was not just the
thing for actual service in an airplane. It had
to fit very tightly around the ears and the
mouth, and as the airplane went to high altitudes
where the air-pressure was much lower
than at the ground level, painful pressures were
produced in the ears which were most annoying.
Aside from that, in actual warfare airplanes
have to operate at extreme heights,
where the air is so rare that oxygen must be
supplied to the aviators, and it was difficult to
provide this supply of oxygen with the radio
helmet tightly strapped to the head of the operator.
But after considerable experiment, this
difficulty was overcome and also that of the
varying pressures on the ears.</p>

<p>Another great difficulty was to obtain a steady
supply of power on the airplane to operate the
transmitting-apparatus. It has been the practice
to supply current on airplanes for wireless-telegraph
apparatus by means of a small electric
generator which is revolved by a little propeller.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
The propeller in turn is revolved by
the rush of air as it is carried along by the plane.
But the speed of the airplane varies considerably.
At times, it may be traveling at only
forty miles per hour, and at other times as high
as one hundred and sixty miles per hour, so
that the little generator is subjected to great
variations of speed and consequent variations
of voltage. This made it impossible to produce
the steady oscillations that are required in wireless
telephony. After considerable experiment,
a generator was produced with two windings,
one of which operated through a vacuum tube,
somewhat like an audion, and to resist the increase
of voltage produced by the other winding.</p>

<p>Then another trouble developed. The sparks
produced by the magneto in the airplane motor
set up electro-magnetic waves which seriously
affected the receiving-instrument. There was
no way of getting rid of the magneto, but the
wires leading from it to the engine were incased
in metal tubes which were grounded at
frequent intervals, and in that way the trouble
was overcome to a large extent. The magnetos
themselves were also incased in such a way that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
electro-magnetic waves would not be radiated
from them.</p>

<p>Instead of using trailing wires which were
liable to become entangled in the propeller, the
antenna was extended from the upper plane to
the tail of the machine, and later it was found
that by using two short trailing antennæ one
from each tip of the wings, the very best results
could be obtained. Still another development
was to embed the antenna wires in the wings
of the plane.</p>

<p>It was considered necessary, if the apparatus
was to be practicable, to be able to use it over
a distance of two thousand yards, but in experiments
conducted in October, 1917, a couple of
airplanes were able to talk to each other when
twenty-three miles apart, and conversations
were carried on with the ground from a distance
of forty-five miles. The conditions under which
these distances were attained were unusual, and
a distance of three miles was accepted as a
standard for communication between airplanes.
The apparatus weighed only fifty-eight pounds
and it was connected with both the pilot and the
observer so that they could carry on conversations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
with each other and could both hear
the conversation with other airplanes or the
ground. As a matter of fact, airplanes with
standard apparatus are able to talk clearly to a
distance of five miles and even to a distance of
ten miles when conditions are favorable, and
they can receive messages from the ground over
almost any distance.</p>

<p>A similar apparatus was constructed for submarine-chasers
with a standard range of conversation
of over five miles. Apparatus was
manufactured in large quantities in this country
and all our submarine-chasers were equipped
with it, as well as a great many of our airplanes
and seaplanes, and we furnished radio-apparatus
sets to our allies which proved of immense
value in the war. This was particularly
so in the case of submarine detection, when it
was possible for a seaplane or a balloon to report
its findings at once to submarine-chasers
and destroyers, and to guide them in pursuit of
submarines.</p>

<p>The improved audion holds out a wonderful
future for radiotelephony. For receiving,
at least, no elaborate aërial will be needed, and
with a small loop of wire, an audion or two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
and simple tuning-apparatus any one can hear
the radio gossip of the whole world.</p>

<h3>TELEGRAPHING TWELVE HUNDRED WORDS PER
MINUTE</h3>

<p>Some remarkable advances were made in
telegraphy also. During the war and since,
messages have been sent direct from Washington
to all parts of the world. In the telegraph
room operators are connected by wire with the
different radio stations along the coast and they
can control the radio transmitters, sending their
messages without any repeating at the radio
stations. Long messages are copied off on a
machine something like a type-writer, which,
however, does not make type impressions, but
cuts perforations in a long sheet of paper. The
paper is then run through a transmitter at a
high speed and the message is sent out at a rate
of as much as twelve hundred words a minute.
At the receiving-station, the message is received
photographically on a strip of paper. The receiving-instrument
has a fine quartz thread in
it, which carries a tiny mirror. A beam of light
is reflected from the mirror upon the strip of
sensitized paper. The radio waves twist the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
quartz thread ever so slightly, which makes the
beam of light play back and forth, but of course
the motion is greatly magnified. In this way
a perfect record is made of the message in dots
and dashes, which are translated into the corresponding
letters of the alphabet.</p>

<h3>DETECTING RADIO SPIES</h3>

<p>There is another radio invention which we
contributed during the war, that proved of utmost
service in thwarting German spies and
which is going to prove equally valuable in time
of peace. Although a war invention, its peacetime
service will be to save lives. It is a very
simple matter to rig up a wireless-telegraph
system that will send messages to a considerable
distance, and simpler still to rig up a receiving-set.
European governments have always discouraged
amateur radiotelegraphy, but in this
country restrictions used to be so slight that
almost any one could set up and use a radio
set, both for receiving and for transmitting.
When we entered the war we were glad that
amateurs had been encouraged to play with
wireless, because we had hundreds of good radio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
operators ready to work the sets which the army
and the navy needed.</p>

<p>But this was a disadvantage, too. Many
operators were either Germans or pro-Germans
and were only too willing to use their radio experience
in the interest of our enemies. It was
a simple matter to obtain the necessary apparatus,
because there was plenty of it to be had
everywhere. They could send orders to fellow
workers and receive messages from them, or
they could listen to dispatches sent out by the
government and glean information of great military
and naval importance. The apparatus
could easily be concealed: a wire hung inside
a chimney, a water-pipe, even a brass bedstead
could be used for the receiving-aërial. It was
highly important that these concealed stations
be located, but how were they to be discovered?</p>

<h3>THE WIRELESS COMPASS</h3>

<p>This problem was solved very nicely. The
audion had made it possible to receive radio
signals on a very small aërial. In place of the
ordinary stationary aërial a frame five feet
square was set up so that it could be turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
to any point of the compass. A few turns of
copper-bronze wire were wound round it. This
was called the "wireless compass." It was set
up on the roof of the radio station and concealed
within a cupola. The shaft on which it was
mounted extended down into the operating-room
and carried a wheel by which it could be
turned. On the shaft was a circular band of
aluminum engraved with the 360 degrees of the
circle, and a couple of fixed pointers indicated
true north and south. Now when a signal was
received by the aërial, if it struck the frame
edgewise the radio waves would reach one side
before they would the other. Taking a single
wave, as shown by the drawing, <a href="#ip_204">Fig.&nbsp;11</a>, we
see that while the crest of the wave is sweeping
over one side of the frame, the trough of the
wave is passing the other side. Two currents
are set up in the radio compass, one in the
wires at the near side of the compass, and another
in the wires at the far side of the compass.
As these currents are of the same direction,
they oppose each other and tend to kill
each other off, but one of the currents is
stronger than the other because the crest of the
wave is sweeping over that side, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
trough of the wave is passing over the other.
The length of the wave may be anything, but
always one side will be stronger than the other,
and a current equal in strength to the difference
between the two currents goes down into the
operating-room and affects the receiver. Now
when the compass is set at right angles to the
oncoming wave, both sides are affected simultaneously
and with the same strength, so that
they kill each other off completely, and no
current goes down to the receiver. Thus the
strength of the signal received can be varied
from a maximum, when the compass is parallel
to the oncoming waves, to zero, when it is at
right angles to them.</p>

  <div class="captionl">Courtesy of the "Scientific American"</div>

<div class="caption0"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span> The radio compass turned parallel to an oncoming
electro-magnetic wave</div></div>

<p>To find out where a sending-station is, the
compass is turned until the loudest sound is
heard in the receiver and then the compass
dial shows from what direction the signals are
coming. At the same time, another line on the
signals will be found by a second station with
another compass. These directions are traced
on a map; and where they meet, the sending-station
must be located.</p>

<p>With this apparatus it was possible to locate
the direction of the station within a degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
After the station had been located as closely
as possible in this way, a motor-truck was sent
out in which there was a concealed radio compass.
The truck would patrol the region
located by the fixed compasses, and with it the
position of the concealed station could be determined
with perfect accuracy. The building
would be raided and its occupants jailed and the
radio equipment confiscated.</p>

<p>Even receiving-sets were discovered with the
portable compass, but to find them was a far
more difficult task. For the receiving of messages
from distant points without a conspicuous
aërial an audion would have to be used and this
would set up feeble oscillations which could be
picked up under favorable conditions by the
portable compass.</p>

<h3>PILOTING SHIPS INTO PORT</h3>

<p>And now for the peace-time application of all
this. If the compass could be used to find those
who tried to hide, why could it not also be used
to find those who wished to be found?</p>

<p>Every now and then a ship runs upon the
rocks because it has lost its bearings in the fog.
But there will be no excuse for such accidents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
now. A number of radio-compass stations have
been located around the entrance and approach
to New York Harbor. Similar stations have
been, or soon will be, established at other ports.
As soon as a ship arrives within fifty or a
hundred miles of port she is required to call for
her bearings. The operator of the control station
instructs the ship to send her call letters
for thirty seconds, and at the same time notifies
each compass station to get a bearing on the
ship. This each does, reporting back to the control
station. The bearings are plotted on a
chart and inside of two minutes from the time
the ship gives her call letters, her bearing is
flashed to her by radio from the control station.</p>

<p>The chart on which the plotting is done is

pierced through the glass at the location of each
compass station. See <a href="#ip_206">Fig.&nbsp;12.</a> On the chart,
around each station, there is a dial marked off
in the 360 degrees of the circle. A thread
passes through the chart and the hole in the
glass at each station. These threads are attached
to weights under the chart. When a
compass station reports a bearing, the thread
of that station is pulled out and extended across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
the corresponding degree on the dial. The
same is done as each station reports and where
the threads cross, the ship must be located.</p>

<p>Not only can the direction-finder be used to
pilot a ship into a harbor, but it will also serve
to prevent collisions at sea, because a ship
equipped with a radio compass can tell whether
another ship is coming directly toward her.</p>

<p>And so as one of the happy outcomes of the
dreadful war, we have an apparatus that will
rob sea-fogs of their terrors to navigation.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Warriors of the Paint-Brush</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">When</span> the great European war broke out,
it was very evident that the Entente
Allies would have to exercise every resource
to beat the foe which had been preparing for
years to conquer the world. But who ever
imagined that geologists would be called in to
choose the best places for boring mines under
the enemy: that meteorologists would be summoned
to forecast the weather and determine
the best time to launch an offensive; that psycologists
would be employed to pick out the men
with the best nerves to man the machine-guns
and pilot the battle-planes? Certainly no one
guessed that artists and the makers of stage
scenery would play an important part in the
conflict.</p>

<p>But the airplane filled the sky with eyes that
at first made it impossible for an army to conceal
its plans from the enemy. And then there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
were eyes that swam in the sea&mdash;cruel eyes that
belonged to deadly submarine monsters, eyes
that could see without being seen, eyes that
could pop up out of the water at unexpected
moments, eyes that directed deadly missiles at
inoffensive merchantmen. They were cowardly
eyes, too, which gave the ship no opportunity
to strike back at the unseen enemy. A vessel's
only safety lay in the chance that out in the
broad reaches of the ocean it might pass beyond
the range of those lurking eyes. It was a game
of hide-and-seek in which the pursuer and not
the pursued was hidden. Something had to be
done to conceal the pursued as well, but in the
open sea there was nothing to hide behind.</p>

<h3>HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT</h3>

<p>There is such a thing as hiding in plain sight.
You can look right at a tree-toad without seeing
him, because his colors blend perfectly with
the tree to which he is clinging. You can watch
a green leaf curl up and shrivel without realizing
that the curled edge is really a caterpillar,
cunningly veined and colored to look just like
a dying leaf; and out in the woods a speckled
bird or striped animal will escape observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
just because it matches the spotted light that
comes through the underbrush. Nature is
constantly protecting its helpless animals
with colored coats that blend with the surroundings.</p>

<p>Long ago clumsy attempts at concealment
were made when war-vessels were given a coat
of dark-gray paint which was supposed to make
them invisible at a distance. Actually the
paint made them more conspicuous; but, then,
concealment did not count for very much before
the present war.</p>

<p>It was the eyes of the submarines that
brought a hurry call for the artists, and up to
them was put the problem of hiding ships in
plain sight. A new name was coined for these
warriors of the paint-brush: <i>camoufleurs</i> they
were called, and their work was known as
<i>camouflage</i>.</p>

<h3>MATCHING THE SKY</h3>

<p>Of course, no paint will make a ship absolutely
invisible at a short distance, but a large
vessel may be made to disappear completely
from view at a distance of six or seven miles
if it is properly painted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
To be invisible, a ship must reflect as much
light and the same shade of light as do its surroundings.
If it is seen against the background
of the sea, it must be of a bluish or a greenish
tint, but a submarine lies so low in the water
that any object seen at a distance is silhouetted
against the sky, and so the ship must have a
coat of paint that will reflect the same colors
as does the sky. Now, the sky may be of almost
any color of the rainbow, depending upon the
position of the sun and the amount of vapor or
dust in the air. Fortunately in the North
Sea and the waters about the British Isles,
where most of the submarine attacks took place,
the weather is hazy most of the time, and the
ship had to be painted of such a color that it
would reflect the same light as that reflected by
a hazy sky. With a background of haze and
more or less haze between the ship and the
periscope of the U-boat, it was not a very difficult
matter to paint a ship so that it would be
invisible six or seven miles away. One shade of
gray was used to conceal a ship in the North
Sea and an entirely different shade was used
for the brighter skies of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In this way, the artists made it possible for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
ships to sail in safety much nearer the pursuer
who was trying to find them, and by just so much
they reduced his powers of destruction. But
still the odds were too heavy against the merchantman.
Something must be done for him
when he found himself within the seven-mile
danger-zone. Here again the artists came to
the rescue.</p>

<div class="caption0">Observing the Enemy from a Papier-Mâché Replica
of a Dead Horse</div></div>

<p>Before merchant ships were armed, a submarine
would not waste a torpedo on them, but
would pound them into submission with shell.
Even after ships were provided with guns, submarines
mounted heavier guns and unless a
ship was speedy enough to show a clean pair
of heels, the pursuing U-boat would stand off
out of range of the ship's guns and pour a
deadly fire into it. But the ships, too, mounted
larger guns and the submarines had to fall back
upon their torpedoes.</p>

<h3>GETTING THE RANGE FOR THE TORPEDO</h3>

<p>In order to fire its torpedo with any certainty,
the U-boat had to get within a thousand yards
of its victim. A torpedo travels at from
thirty to forty miles per hour. It takes time
for it to reach its target and a target which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
is moving at, say, fifteen knots, will travel
five hundred yards while a thirty-knot torpedo
is making one hundred yards. And so
before the U-boat commander could discharge
his torpedo, he had to know how fast the
ship was traveling and how far away it was
from him. He could not come to the surface
and make deliberate observations, but had to
stay under cover, not daring even to keep his
eye out of water, for fear that the long wake
of foam trailing behind the periscope would
give him away. All he could do, then, was
to throw his periscope up for a momentary
glimpse and make his calculations very quickly;
then he could move to the position he figured
that he should occupy and shoot up his periscope
for another glimpse to check up his calculations.
On the glass of this periscope, there
were a number of graduations running vertically
and horizontally. If he knew his victim
and happened to know the height of its smoke-stacks
or the length of the boat, he noted how
many graduations they covered, and then by a
set formula he could tell how far he was from
the boat. At the same time he had to work out
its rate of travel and note carefully the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
it was holding before he could figure where
his torpedo must be aimed.</p>

<p>There was always more or less uncertainty
about such observations, because they had to be
taken hastily, and the camoufleurs were not slow
to take advantage of this weakness. They increased
the enemy's confusion by painting high
bow-waves which made the ship look as if it were
traveling at high speed. They painted the
bow to look like the stern, and the stern to look
like the bow, and the stacks were painted so that
they appeared to slant in the opposite direction,
so that it would look as if the vessel were
headed the other way. U-boats came to have a
very wholesome respect for destroyers and
would seldom attack a ship if one of these
fast fighting-craft was about, and so destroyers
were painted on the sides of ships as scarecrows
to frighten off the enemy.</p>

<h3>MAKING STRAIGHT LINES LOOK CROOKED</h3>

<p>We say that "seeing is believing," but it is
not very hard to deceive the eye. The lines in
<a href="#ip_217">Fig.&nbsp;13</a> look absolutely parallel, and they are;
but cross-hatch the spaces between them, with
the hatching reversed in alternate spaces, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
<a href="#ip_217b">Fig.&nbsp;14</a>, and they no longer look straight.
Take the letters on the left, <a href="#ip_217c">Fig.&nbsp;15.</a> They
look all higgledy-piggledy, but they are really
straight and parallel, as one can prove by laying
a straight-edge against them, or by drawing
a straight line through each letter, as shown at
the right, <a href="#ip_234">Fig.&nbsp;16.</a> Such illusions were used on
ships. Stripes were painted on the hull that
tapered slightly, from bow to stern, so that the
vessel appeared to be headed off at an angle,
when it was really broadside to the watcher at
the other end of the periscope.</p>

<div class="caption0"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span> Letters that look all higgledy-piggledy, but are

<p>There are color illusions, too, that were tried.
If you draw a red chalk-mark and a blue one on
a perfectly clean blackboard, the red line will
seem to stand out and the blue one to sink into
the black surface of the board, because your eye
has to focus differently for the two colors, and
a very dazzling effect can be had with alternating
squares of blue and red. Other colors give
even more dazzling effects, and some of them,
when viewed at a distance, will blend into the
very shade of gray that will make a boat invisible
at six miles. When U-boat commanders
took observations on a ship painted with a
"dazzle" camouflage, they saw a shimmering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
image which it was hard for them to measure on
the fine graduations of their periscopes. Some
ships were painted with heavy blotches of black
and white, and the enemy making a hasty observation
would be apt to focus his attention
on the dark masses and overlook the white parts.
So he was likely to make a mistake in estimating
the height of the smoke-stack or in measuring
the apparent length of a vessel.</p>

<h3>A JOKE ON THE PHOTOGRAPHER</h3>

<p>Early in the submarine campaign one of our
boats was given a coat of camouflage, and when
the vessel sailed from its pier in the North
River, New York, the owners sent a photographer
two or three piers down the river to
photograph the ship as she went by. He took
the picture, but when the negative was developed,
much to his astonishment he found
that the boat was not all on the plate. In the
finder of his camera, he had mistaken a heavy
band of black paint for the stern of the ship,
quite overlooking the real stern, which was
painted a grayish white. The artist had fooled
the photographer and at a distance of not more
than two or three hundred yards!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<h3>SEEING BEYOND THE HORIZON</h3>

<p>The periscope of a submarine that is running
awash can be raised about fifteen feet above
the water, which means that the horizon as
viewed from that elevation is about six miles
away, and if you draw a circle with a six-mile
radius on the map of the Atlantic, you
will find that it is a mere speck in the ocean;
but a U-boat commander could see objects
that lay far beyond his horizon because he was
searching for objects which towered many feet
above the water. The smoke-stacks of some
vessels rise a hundred feet above the water-line,
and the masts reach up to much greater
altitudes. Aside from this, in the early days
of the war steamers burned soft coal and their
funnels belched forth huge columns of smoke
which was visible from twenty to thirty miles
away.</p>

<p>When this was realized, efforts were made
to cut down the superstructure of a ship as much
as possible. Some vessels had their stacks
cut down almost to the deck-line, and air-pumps
were installed to furnish the draft necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
keep their furnaces going. They had no masts
except for slender iron pipes which could be
folded down against the deck and could be
erected at a moment's notice, to carry the
aërials of the wireless system. Over the ship
from stem to stern was stretched, a cable,
familiarly known as a "clothes-line," upon
which were laid strips of canvas that completely
covered the superstructure of the ship.
These boats lay so low that they could not be
seen at any great distance, and it was difficult
for the U-boats to find them. They were slow
boats; too slow to run away from a modern
submarine, but because of their lowly structure,
they managed to elude the German U-boats.
When they were seen, the U-boat commanders
were afraid of them. They were suspicious of
anything that looked out of the ordinary, and
preferred to let the "clothes-line ships" go.</p>

<h3>THE BRITISH MYSTERY SHIPS</h3>

<p>The Germans had some very unhealthy experiences
with the "Q-boats" or "mystery
ships" of the British. These were vessels
rigged up much like ordinary tramp steamers,
but they were loaded with wood, so that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
would not sink, and their hatches were arranged
to fall open at the touch of a button, exposing
powerful guns. They also were equipped with
torpedo-tubes, so that they could give the U-boat
a dose of its own medicine. These ships would
travel along the lanes frequented by submarines,
and invite attack. They would limp along as
if they had been injured by a storm or a U-boat
attack, and looked like easy prey. When a submarine
did attack them, they would send out
frantic calls for help, and they had so-called
"panic" parties which took to the boats. Meantime,
a picked crew remained aboard, carefully
concealed from view, and the captain kept his
eye upon the enemy through a periscope disguised
as a small ventilator, waiting for the
U-boat to come within range of certain destruction.
Sometimes the panic party would lure
the submarine into a favorable position by
rowing under the stern as if to hide around the
other side of the ship. At the proper moment,
up would go the white ensign&mdash;the British
man-of-war flag&mdash;the batteries would be unmasked,
and a hail of shell would break loose
over the Hun. Many a German submarine was
accounted for by such traps.</p>

<div class="caption0">A Camouflaged Ship in the Hudson River on Victory Day</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
Submarines themselves used all sorts of
camouflage. They were frequently equipped
with sails which they would raise to disguise
themselves as peaceful sloops, and in this way
they were able to steal up on a victim without
discovery. Sometimes they would seize a ship
and hide behind it in order to get near their
prey.</p>

<h3>CAMOUFLAGE ON LAND</h3>

<p>But the call for the wielders of the paintbrush
came not only from the sea. Their services
were needed fully as much on land, and the
making of land camouflage was far more interesting
because it was more varied and more
successful. Besides, it called for more than
mere paint; all sorts of tricks with canvas,
grass, and branches were used. Of course, the
soldiers were garbed in dust-colored clothing
and shiny armor was discarded. The helmets
they wore were covered with a material that cast
no gleam of light. In every respect, they tried
to make themselves of the same shade as their
surroundings. Like the Indians, they painted
their faces. This was done when they made
their raids at night. They painted their faces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
black so that they would not show the faintest
reflection of light.</p>

<h3>A PAPER HORSE</h3>

<p>The most interesting camouflage work was
done for the benefit of snipers or for observers
at listening-posts close to the enemy trenches.
It was very important to spy on the enemy and
discover his plans, and so men were sent out
as near his lines as possible, to listen to the conversation
and to note any signs of unusual activity
which would be likely to precede a raid.
These men were supplied with telephone wires
which they dragged over No Man's Land, and
by which they could communicate their discoveries
to headquarters. Some very ingenious
listening-posts were established. In one case
a papier-mâché duplicate of a dead horse was
made, which was an exact facsimile of an animal
that had been shot and lay between the two
lines. One night, the carcass of the horse was
removed and the papier-mâché replica took its
place. In the latter a man was stationed with
telephone connection back to his own lines.
Here he had an excellent chance to watch the
enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
On another occasion a standing tree, whose
branches had been shot away, was carefully
photographed and an exact copy of it made, but
with a chamber inside in which an observer could
be concealed. One night while the noise of the
workmen was drowned by heavy cannonading,
this tree was removed and its facsimile was set
up instead, and it remained for many a day before
the enemy discovered that it was a fake
tree-trunk. It provided a tall observation post
from which an observer could direct the fire of
his own artillery.</p>

<h3>FOOLING THE WATCHERS IN THE SKY</h3>

<p>In the early stages of the war, it seemed impossible
to hide anything from the Germans.
They had eyes everywhere and were able to anticipate
everything the Allies did. But the
spies that infested the sky were the worst handicap.
Even when the Allies gained control of
the air, the control was more or less nominal
because every now and then an enemy observer
would slip over or under the patrolling aëroplanes
and make photographs of the Allies'
lines. The photographs were carefully compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
with others previously taken, that the
slightest change in detail might be discovered.
Airplane observers not only would be ready
to drop bombs on any suspicious object or upon
masses of troops moving along the roads, but
would telephone back to their artillery to direct
its fire upon these targets. Of course, the
enemy knew where the roads were located and
a careful watch was kept of them.</p>

<p>The French did not try to hide the roads, but
they concealed the traffic on the roads by hanging
rows of curtains over them. As these curtains
hung vertically and were spaced apart, one
would suppose that they would furnish little
concealment, but they prevented an observer
in an aëroplane from looking down the length
of a road. All the road he could see was that
which lay directly under his machine, because
there he could look between the curtains; if
he looked obliquely at the road, the curtains
would appear to overlap one another and would
conceal operations going on under them.</p>

<p>In one case, the Germans completely covered
a sunken road with canvas painted to represent
a road surface. Under this canvas canopy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
troops were moved to an important strategic
point without the slightest indication of such a
movement.</p>

<h3>HIDING BIG GUNS</h3>

<p>Nature's tricks of camouflage were freely used
in the hiding of the implements of war on land.
Our big guns were concealed by being painted
with leopard spots and tiger stripes, the color
and nature of the camouflage depending upon
the station they were to occupy. In many cases,
they were covered with branches of trees or
with rope netting overspread with leaves. So
careful was the observation of the air scouts
that even the grass scorched by the fire of the
gun had to be covered with green canvas to
prevent betrayal of the position of the gun.</p>

<h3>ROADS THAT LED NOWHERE</h3>

<p>In the making of an emplacement for a gun
it was of the utmost importance that no fresh
upturned earth be disclosed to the aërial observers.
Even foot-paths leading to it had to
be concealed. Plans were carefully made to
cover up all traces of the work before the work
was begun. Where it was impossible to conceal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
the paths, they were purposely made to lead
well beyond the point where the emplacement
was building, and, still further to deceive the
enemy, a show of work was sometimes undertaken
at the end of the path. Wherever the
sod had to be upturned, it was covered over
with green canvas. The earth that was removed
had to be concealed somewhere and the
best place of concealment was found to be some
old shell-hole which would hold a great deal
of earth without any evidence that would be apparent
to an observer in an aëroplane. If no
shell-hole were handy, the excavated material
had to be hauled for miles before a safe dumping-ground
could be found. As far as possible
everything was sunk below the earth level.
Big pits were dug in which the mortars were
placed, or if a shell-hole were empty, this was
used instead.</p>

<h3>SHADOWLESS BUILDINGS</h3>

<p>Any projection above the ground was apt to
cast a shadow which would show up on the observer's
photographs. This was a difficulty
that was experienced in building the hangars
for airplanes. The roofs of these sheds were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
painted green so as to match the sod around
them, but as they projected above their surroundings,
they cast shadows which made them
clearly evident to the enemy. This was overcome
by the building of shadowless hangars;
that is, hangars with roofs that extended all
the way to the ground at such an angle that they
would cause no shadow except when the sun was
low. In some cases, aëroplanes were housed
in underground hangars, the approach to which
was concealed by a canvas covering. As for
the machines themselves, they scorned the use
of camouflage. Paint was little protection to
them. Some attempt was made to use transparent
wings of <i>cellon</i>, a material similar to
celluloid, but this did not prove a success.</p>

<h3>THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EYE</h3>

<p>Although camoufleurs made perfect imitations
of natural objects and surroundings, they were
greatly concerned to find that the flying observers
could see through their disguises. To the
naked eye the landscape would not show the
slightest trace of any suspicions object, but by
the use of a color-screen to cut out certain rays
of light, a big difference would be shown between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
the real colors of nature and the artist's copies
of them. For instance, if a roof painted to
look like green grass were viewed through a
red color-screen, it would look brown; while the
real grass, which apparently was of exactly the
same shade as the roof, would look red. It
had not been realized by the artists who had
never studied the composition of light, that there
is a great deal of red in the green light reflected
by grass, and that if they were to duplicate
this shade of green, they must put a certain
amount of red paint in their imitation grass
roofs. Air scouts did not depend upon their
eyes alone, but used cameras so that they could
study their photographs at their leisure and by
fitting the cameras with different color-screens,
they could analyze the camouflage and undo the
patient work of the artist.</p>

<h3>A CALL FOR THE PHYSICIST</h3>

<p>To meet this situation, another man was summoned
to help&mdash;the physicist, who looks upon
color merely as waves of ether; who can pick
a ray of light to pieces just as a chemist can
analyze a lump of sugar. Under his expert
guidance, colors of nature were imitated so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
they would defy detection. Aside from this, the
physicist helped to solve the tricks of the
enemy's camoufleurs.</p>

<p>But the physicist had barely rolled up his
sleeves and got into the fray when the armistice
was signed which put an end to the shams
as well as to the realities of the great war.
While the work of camouflage was not completed,
we owe an inestimable debt to the men
who knew how to fake scenery and to their
learned associates who count the wave lengths
of light, and although their trade was a trade of
deception and shams, there was no sham about
the service they rendered.</p>

<h3>MAKING SHIPS VISIBLE</h3>

<p>While in war safety lies in invisibility, in
peace the reverse is true. Now that the war is
over, it may seem that the work of the camoufleurs
can find no useful application; but it
was impossible to learn how to make objects
invisible without also learning how to make
them conspicuously visible. As a consequence,
we know now how to paint a ship so that it
will show up more clearly in foggy weather,
thereby reducing the danger of collision. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
know, too, how to paint light-ships, buoys, etc.,
so that they will be much more conspicuous
and better guides to mariners, and how to color
railroad signals and road signs so that they
will be more easily seen by locomotive engineers
and automobile drivers.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">It</span> was an American invention that dragged
America into the war&mdash;an American invention
in the hands of barbarians and put to unspeakably
barbarous use.</p>

<p>After seeing how the Huns used the submarine
we are not so sure that we can take much
pride in its invention. But if any blame attaches
to us for developing the submarine, we
made amends by the way in which we fought the
German U-boat and put an end to German
frightfulness on the sea. Of course, the credit
for Germany's defeat is not for a moment
claimed by Americans alone, but it must be admitted
that we played an important part in
overcoming the menace of the U-boat.</p>

<p>There is no question that the submarine was
an American invention. To be sure, we can look
into ancient books and find suggestions for navigating
under the surface of the sea, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
first man who did actually build a successful
submarine was David Bushnell, back in the
Revolutionary War. After him came Robert
Fulton, who carried the invention farther. He
built and operated a submarine for the French
Government, and, in more recent years, the submarine
became a practical vessel of war in the
hands of John P. Holland and Simon Lake,
both Americans. However, we are not interested,
just now, in the history of the submarine,
but rather in the development of this craft
during the recent war.</p>

<p>With Great Britain as an enemy, Germany
knew that she was hopelessly outclassed on the
sea; but while "Britannia ruled the waves," she
did not rule the depths of the sea, and so Germany
decided to claim this realm for her own.
Little attention did she pay to surface vessels.
Except in the Dogger Bank engagement and the
Battle of Jutland, the German first-class vessels
did not venture out upon the open sea, and
even the lighter craft merely made occasional
raids under cover of fog or darkness, only
to cut and run as soon as the British vessels
appeared. The submarine boat, or <i>unterseeboot</i>
as the Germans called it, was virtually the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
only boat that dared go out into the high seas;
consequently, the Germans specialized upon
that type of craft and under their close attention
it grew into a highly perfected war-vessel.
But the Germans were not the only ones to develop
the submarine, as we shall see.</p>

<h3>CONSTRUCTION OF THE U-BOATS</h3>

<p>When the great war broke out, the German U-boat
was a comparatively small craft, less than
150 feet long, with its main hull only 12 feet in
diameter. It could make a speed of 12 knots on
the surface and only 9 when submerged. But
as the war progressed, it grew larger and
larger, until it attained a length of over 300
feet and its speed was increased to 12 knots
when submerged and 18 knots on the surface.</p>

<p>Figs. 16 to 18 show the construction of one
of the early U-boats. The later boats were
built after the same general plan, but on a
bigger scale.</p>

<p>It is not always safe to judge a thing by its
name; to do so is apt to lead to sad mistakes.
One would naturally suppose, from its name,
that a submarine is a boat that lives under
water, like a fish. But it is not a fish; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
an air-breathing animal that prefers to stay
on the surface, only occasionally diving under to
hide from danger or to steal upon its prey.
During the war, the German U-boats did not
average three hours per day under the surface!
Because they were intended to run on the surface
they had to be built in the form of a surface
vessel, so as to throw off the waves and
keep from rolling and pitching too much in a
seaway. But they also had to be built to withstand
the crushing weight of deep water, and as
a cylinder is much stronger than a structure of
ordinary boat shape, the main hull was made circular
in section and of heavy plating, strongly
framed, while around this was an outer hull
of boat shape, as shown in <a href="#ip_238">Fig.&nbsp;18.</a></p>

<h3>PUTTING HOLES IN A TANK TO KEEP IT FULL</h3>

<p>The space between the inner and outer
hulls was used for water ballast and for reservoirs
of oil to drive the engines; and, strange
as it may seem, the oil-tanks were always kept
full by means of holes in the bottom of them.
As the oil was consumed by the engines, water
would flow into the reservoir to take its place,
and the oil, being lighter than water, would float<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
on top. The false hull was of light metal, because
as it was open to the sea, the pressure on
the inside was always the same as that on the
outside. The reservoirs of oil and the water-ballast
tanks protected the inner hull of the
vessel from accidental damage and from hostile
shell and bombs. There were water-ballast
tanks inside the inner hull as well, as shown in
the cross-sectional view, <a href="#ip_238">Fig.&nbsp;18.</a> The water
in the ballast-tanks was blown out by compressed
air to lighten the U-boat and the boat
was kept on an even keel by the blowing out
or the letting in of water in the forward and
after tanks.</p>

<div id="ip_238" class="figcenter" style="width: 317px;">

<div class="captionh0"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span> Transverse section through conning-tower, showing
the interior (circular) pressure-resisting hull and the
lighter exterior hull, which is open to the sea</div></div>

<p>A heavy lead keel was attached to the bottom
of the boat, to keep it from rolling too much.
In case of accident, if there were no other way of
bringing the boat to the surface, this keel could
be cast loose.</p>

<p>At the forward end, where the torpedo-tubes
were located, there was a torpedo-trimming
tank. Torpedoes are heavy missiles and every
time one was discharged the boat was lightened,
and the balance of the submarine was upset.
To make up for the loss of weight, water had
to be let into the torpedo-trimming tank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
A submarine cannot float under-water without
swimming; in other words, it must keep its
propellers going to avoid either sinking to the
bottom of the sea or bobbing up to the surface.
To be sure, it can make itself heavier or lighter
by letting water into or blowing water out of
its ballast-tanks, but it is impossible to regulate
the water ballast so delicately that the submarine
will float submerged; and should the
boat sink to a depth of two hundred feet or so,
the weight of water above it would be sufficient
to crush the hull, so it is a case of sink
or swim. Usually enough ballast is taken on
to make the submarine only a little lighter than
the water it displaces; and then to remain under,
the vessel must keep moving, with its horizontal
rudders tilted to hold it down. The horizontal
rudders or hydroplanes of the U-boat
are shown in <a href="#ip_234b">Fig.&nbsp;17</a>, both at the bow and at
the stern.</p>

<p>The main hull of the vessel was literally filled
with machinery. In the after part of the boat
were the Diesel oil-engines with which the
U-boat was propelled when on the surface.
There were two engines, each driving a propeller-shaft.
It was impossible to use the engines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
when the vessel was submerged, not because
of the gases they produced&mdash;these could
easily have been carried out of the boat&mdash;but
because every internal-combustion engine consumes
enormous quantities of air. In a few
minutes the engines would devour all the air
in the hull of the submarine and would then
die of suffocation. And so the engines were
used only when the submarine was running
awash or on the surface, and then the air consumed
by them would rush down the hatchway
like a hurricane to supply their mighty lungs.</p>

<h3>ENGINES THAT BURN HEAVY OIL</h3>

<p>The oil-engines were strictly a German invention.
In the earlier days of the submarine
gasolene-engines were used, but despite every
precaution, gasolene vapors occasionally would
leak out of the reservoirs and accumulate in
pockets or along the floors of the hull, and it
needed but a spark to produce an explosion
that would blow up the submarine. But
Rudolph Diesel, a German, invented an engine
which would burn heavy oils.</p>

<div id="ip_240" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
  <img src="images/i_240.jpg" width="500" height="346" alt="" /><br />
  <div class="captionl">(C) Underwood &amp; Underwood</div>

<div class="caption0">Complex Mass of Wheels and Dials inside a German Submarine</div></div>

<p>In the Diesel engine there are no spark-plugs
and no magneto: the engine fires itself without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
electrical help. Air is let into the cylinder
at ordinary atmospheric pressure, or fifteen
pounds per square inch. But it is compressed
by the upward stroke of the piston to about
five hundred pounds per square inch. When
air is compressed it develops heat and the sudden
high compression to over thirty times its
normal pressure raises the temperature to something
like 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. Just as
this temperature is reached, a jet of oil is blown
into the cylinder by air under still higher pressure.
Immediately the spray of oil bursts into
flame and the hot gases of combustion drive the
piston down. Because of the intense heat almost
any oil, from light gasolene to heavy, almost
tarlike oils, can be used. As heavy oils
do not throw off any explosive vapors unless
they are heated, they make a very safe fuel for
submarines.</p>

<div class="caption0">Surrendered German Submarines, showing the Net Cutters at the Bow</div></div>

<p>To drive the U-boat when no air was to be had
for the engines, electric motors were used.
There was one on each propeller-shaft and the
shafts could be disconnected from the oil-engines
when the motors were driving. The motors
got their power from storage batteries in
the stern of the submarine and under the floors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
forward. The motors when coupled to and
driven by the engines generated current which
was stored in the storage batteries. The submarine
could not run on indefinitely underwater.
When its batteries were exhausted it
would have to come to the surface and run its
engines to store up a fresh charge of electricity.
The electric motors gave the boat a speed of
about nine knots.</p>

<p>In addition to the main engines and motors,
there was a mass of auxiliary machinery.
There were pumps for compressing air to blow
the ballast-tanks and to discharge the torpedoes.
There was a special mechanism for operating
the rudder and hydroplanes, and all sorts of
valves, indicators, speaking-tubes, signal lines,
etc. The tiny hull was simply crammed with
mechanism of all kinds and particularly in the
early boats there was little room for the accommodation
of the officers and crew. The officers'
quarters were located amidships, and forward
there were the folding berths of the crews. In
the later boats more space was given the men.
The large U-boats carried a crew of forty and
as the hazards of submarine warfare increased,
more attention had to be paid to the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<h3>FAT MEN NOT WANTED</h3>

<p>Oddly enough, small, slender men were preferred
for submarine duty, not because of lack
of space, but because it was apt to be very cold
in a submarine, particularly in the winter-time.
The water cooled off the boat when the submarine
was traveling submerged, and the motors
gave off little heat; while when the vessel was
running on the surface the rush of wind to supply
the engines kept the thermometer low. This
meant that the men had to pile on much clothing
to keep warm, which made them very bulky.
The hatchway was none too large and a fat man,
were he bundled up with enough clothing to keep
him warm, would have a hard time squeezing
through.</p>

<p>In the center of the vessel was the main hatchway,
leading up to the conning-tower, which
was large enough to hold from three to five men.
This was the navigating-room when the vessel
was running submerged, and above it was the
navigating-bridge, used when the submarine
was on the surface. In the conning-tower there
was a gyroscopic compass; a magnetic compass
would not work at all inside the steel hull of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
the U-boat. And here were the periscopes or
eyes of the submarine, rising from fifteen to
twenty feet above the roof of the conning-tower.
There were usually two periscopes.
They could be turned around to give the
man at the wheel a view in any direction and
they were used sometimes even when the vessel
was running on the surface, to give a longer
range of vision.</p>

<h3>THE BLINDNESS OF THE SUBMARINE</h3>

<p>Now, a submarine cannot see anything underwater.
The commander cannot even see the
bow of his boat from the conning-tower, and
until he gets near enough to the surface to
poke his periscope out of water he is absolutely
blind and must feel his way about with compass
and depth-gage. It was always an anxious moment
for the U-boat commander, when he was
coming up, until his periscope broke out of the
water and he could get his bearings; and even
that was attended with danger, for his periscope
might be seen. Of course a periscope
is a very insignificant object on the broad sea,
but when a submarine is moving its periscope
is followed by a wake which is very conspicuous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
and so the U-boat ran a chance of being
discovered and destroyed before it could dive
again to a safe depth. Later, telescoping periscopes
were used, which could be raised by
means of a hand-lever. The submarine would
run along just under the surface and every
now and then it would suddenly raise its periscope
for an observation and drop it down again
under cover if there was danger nigh. This
was much simpler and quicker than having a six-or
eight-hundred-ton boat come up to the surface
and dive to safety. He might even collide
with a vessel floating on the surface, but to
lessen this danger submarines were furnished
with ears or big microphone diaphragms at each
side of the hull by which a ship could be located
by the noise of its propellers.</p>

<p>In the bow were the torpedo-tubes and the
magazine of torpedoes. At first there were only
two torpedo-tubes, but later the number was
increased to four. These were kept constantly
loaded, so that the projectiles could be launched
in rapid succession, if necessary, without a
pause for the insertion of a fresh torpedo. In
some submarines tubes were provided in the
stern also so that the boat could discharge a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
torpedo at its enemy while running away from
him.</p>

<p>Each tube was closed at the outer end by a
cap and at the inside end by a breech-block.
The tube was blown clear of water by means of
compressed air, and of course the outer cap was
closed when the breech was open to let in a torpedo.
Then the breech was closed, the cap
opened, and the torpedo was discharged from
the tube by a blast of air.</p>

<h3>THE TORPEDO</h3>

<p>A torpedo is really a motor-boat, a wonderfully
constructed boat, fitted with an engine
of its own that is driven by compressed
air and which drives the torpedo through the
water at about forty miles per hour. The
motor-boat is shaped like a cigar and that
used by the Germans was about fifteen feet
long and fourteen inches in diameter. We
used much larger torpedoes, some of them
being twenty-two feet long. Ours have a large
compressed-air reservoir and will travel for
miles; but the Germans used their torpedoes
at short ranges of a thousand yards and under,
cutting down the air-reservoir as much as possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
and loading the torpedo with an extra
large explosive charge.</p>

<p>We found in the Diesel engine that when
air is highly compressed it becomes very
hot. When compressed air is expanded, the
reverse takes place, the air becomes very cold.
The air that drives the motor of the torpedo
grows so cold that were no precautions taken
it would freeze any moisture that might be
present and would choke up the engine with the
frost. And so an alcohol flame is used to heat
the air. The air-motor is started automatically
by release of a trigger as the torpedo is blown
out of the torpedo-tube. By means of gearing,
the motor drives two propellers. These run
in opposite directions, so as to balance each
other and prevent any tendency for the torpedo
to swerve from its course. The torpedo is
steered by a rudder which is controlled by a
gyroscope, and it is kept at the proper depth
under water by diving-rudders which are controlled
by a very sensitive valve worked by the
weight of the water above it. The deeper the
water, the greater the weight or pressure; and
the valve is so arranged that, should the torpedo
run too far under, the pressure will cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
the diving-rudders to tilt until the torpedo comes
up again; then if the torpedo rises too high, the
valve will feel the reduction of pressure and
turn the rudders in the other direction.</p>

<p>The business end of a torpedo is a "war-head"
packed with about four hundred
pounds of TNT. At the nose of the torpedo
is a firing-pin, with which the war-head
is exploded. Ordinarily, the firing-pin does
not project from the torpedo, but there is a
little propeller at the forward end which is
turned by the rush of water as the torpedo
is driven on its course. This draws out the
firing-pin and gets everything ready for the
TNT to explode as soon as the firing-pin is
struck. But the firing-pin is not the only means
of exploding the torpedo. Inside there is a very
delicate mechanism that will set off the charge
at the least provocation. In one type of torpedo
a steel ball is provided which rests in a
shallow depression and the slightest shock, the
sudden stopping or even a sudden swerve of the
torpedo, would dislodge the ball and set off the
charge. Hence various schemes, proposed by
inventors, for deflecting a torpedo without
touching the firing-pin, would have been of no
value at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<h3>GUNS ON SUBMARINES</h3>

<p>As torpedoes are expensive things, the
U-boats were supplied with other means of
destroying their victims. The Germans sprang
a surprise by mounting guns on the decks of
their submarines. At first these were arranged
to be lowered into a hatch when the boat was
running submerged, but later they were permanently
mounted on the decks so that they
would be ready for instant use. They were
heavily coated with grease and the bore was
swabbed out immediately when the boat came to
the surface, so that there was no danger of
serious rust and corrosion. The 3-inch gun of
the early months of the war soon gave way to
heavier pieces and the latest U-boats were supplied
with guns of almost 6-inch caliber and
there was a gun on the after deck as well as
forward.</p>

<p>The U-boats depended upon radiotelegraphy
to get their orders and although they did not
have a very wide sending-range, they could receive
messages from the powerful German station
near Berlin. The masts which carried the
radio aërials could be folded down into pockets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
in the deck. From stem to stern over the entire
boat a cable was stretched which was intended to
permit the U-boat to slide under nets protecting
harbor entrances, and in later boats there
were keen-toothed knives at the bow which
would cut through a steel net. During the war
German and Austrian U-boats occupied so much
attention that the public did not realize the
part that the Entente Allies were playing under
the sea. America, Great Britain, France, and
Italy made good use of submarines, operating
them against enemy vessels, blockading enemy
ports, and actually fighting enemy submarines.</p>

<h3>A STEAM-DRIVEN SUBMARINE</h3>

<p>The British in particular did splendid work
with the submarine and developed boats that
were superior to anything turned out by the
Germans. For instance, they developed a submarine
which is virtually a submersible destroyer.
It is 340 feet long and it can make a
speed of 24 knots on the surface. The most
remarkable part of this boat is that its engines
are driven by steam. Its boilers are fired with
oil fuel. There are two smoke-stacks which fold
down when it submerges. Of course when running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
under-water the vessel is driven by electricity
and it makes a speed of 10 knots. It
carries three 4-inch guns, two forward and one
aft, and its displacement submerged is 2700 tons
as against 800 tons for the largest German submarines.</p>

<h3>A SUBMARINE THAT MOUNTS A TWELVE-INCH
GUN</h3>

<p>Still more remarkable is the big "super-submarine"
designed by the British to bombard the
forts of the Dardanelles, but unfortunately it
was built too late to be used there. This submarine
carries a gun big enough for a battle-ship.
It is of 12-inch caliber and weighs 50
tons. Of course a big gun like that could not
be fired athwart the submarine. It might bowl
the little vessel over, even though it was a
1700-ton submarine. The gun is mounted to
fire fore and aft, with a deviation of only a few
degrees to one side or the other, so that the
shock of the recoil is taken by the length instead
of the beam of the submarine. It fires a
shell weighing 620 pounds and a full charge is
not used, so that the extreme range is only
about 15,000 yards. This submarine monitor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
would have been a very difficult target for the
Turkish gunners to hit.</p>

<p>When the war came to an end and the German
submarines surrendered to the Entente
Allies at Harwich, there was considerable
public curiosity as to whether or not an examination
of the U-boats would disclose any
wonderful secrets. But they contained nothing
that the Allies did not already know, and one
British officer stated that the plans of the German
submarines had often fallen into their
hands long before a U-boat of the same type
was captured!</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Getting the Best of the U-Boat</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> U-boat commander who sallied forth
from the harbor of Wilhelmshaven in the
early days of the war had nothing to fear. He
was out to murder, not to fight. His prey was
always out in the open, while he could kill without
exposing more than his eye above water.
Not even a sporting chance was allowed his
victims, particularly when he chose unarmed
merchantmen for his targets. He could come
up boldly to the surface and shell a ship into
submission. This was cheaper than torpedoing
the vessel, because torpedoes are expensive.
If the ship were speedy it might run away; or
if the U-boat came up too close to its intended
prey, the latter might run it down. That happened
occasionally and it was the only danger
that the <i>Herr Kommandant</i> had to fear.</p>

<p>If a destroyer suddenly appeared, the U-boat
could dive into the shelter of the sea. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
water were not too deep, it could lie on the
bottom for two or more days if need be. There
was plenty of air in the hull to sustain life
for many hours, and then the compressed air
used for blowing the ballast-tanks could be
drawn upon. In the U-boat there were potash
cartridges to take up the carbon-dioxide, and
tanks of pure oxygen to revitalize the air. If
the submarine were damaged, it was not necessary
for it to come to the surface to effect repairs.
There were air-locks through which a
diver could be let out of the boat. He was
fitted with oxygen and potash cartridges, so
that he did not need to be connected by an air-hose
with the boat, but could walk around it
freely to mend injured rudders or to clear the
propeller of entanglements.</p>

<p>Even the small submarines of those early
days were capable of taking long voyages.
Setting his course at a comfortable pace of 10
knots, the U-boat commander could count on
enough fuel to carry him 1600 miles, and if
need be he could slow down to 8 knots and by
using certain of his water-ballast tanks for
additional oil-reservoirs, extend his cruising-radius
to nearly 3000 miles. The big 800-ton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
U-boats that were built later had a radius of
5000 miles at an 8-knot speed. And so when
the British closed the English Channel with
nets and mines, <i>Herr Kommandant</i> was not at
all perturbed; he could sail around the British
Isles if he chose and make war upon transatlantic
shipping. When harbors were walled
off with nets, he could remain outside and sink
vessels that were leaving or entering them.</p>

<h3>SUBMARINE-CHASERS</h3>

<p>A real menace came when the U-boat commander
popped his periscope out of the sea
and saw several little motor-boats bearing down
upon him. They seemed harmless enough, but
a moment's inspection showed them to be armed
with guns fully as powerful as those he carried.
It was useless to discharge a torpedo at so
speedy and small a foe. A torpedo has to have
a fairly deep covering of water, else its course
will be disturbed by surface waves; and the
submarine-chasers drew so little water that a
torpedo would pass harmlessly under them.
It was useless for the U-boat commander to
come up and fight them with his guns. They
would have been upon him before he could do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
that, and their speed and diminutive size made
them very difficult targets to hit. Besides, he
dared not risk a duel of shell, for he knew that
if the precious inner hull of his boat were
punctured, he could not seek refuge under
water; and if he could not hide, he was lost.
The little armed mosquito craft swarmed about
the harbor entrances, ready to dash at any submarine
that showed itself. They could travel
twice as fast as the submarine when it was submerged
and half again as fast as when it was
running on the surface.</p>

<p>Submarines had to take to cover when these
chasers were about. <i>Herr Kommandant</i> did
not even dare to take a look around through
his periscope, because the streak of foam that
trailed in its wake would betray him and immediately
the speedy motor-boats would take
up the chase; and they had a disagreeable way
of dropping bombs which, even if they did not
sink the submarine, might produce such a concussion
as to spring its seams. His foes had
discovered one of his most serious defects. He
was blind under-water and they were making
the most of this handicap.</p>

<p>Groping along under-water by dead-reckoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
was not any too safe a procedure near land,
because he was liable at any moment to crash
into an uncharted rock or maybe into the wreck
of some submarine victim. He could not correct
his bearings without coming to the surface,
and, in the black depths of the sea, a slight miscalculation
might send him to his doom. As
was explained in the previous chapter, he had
to keep moving, because he could not remain
suspended under water.</p>

<div class="caption0">A Depth-bomb Mortar and a Set of "Ash Cans" at the Stern of an American Destroyer</div></div>

<p>He was more helpless than a ship sailing
in the densest of fogs. A ship can stop and
listen to sound-signals, or even to the beating
of the surf on the shore, or it can take
soundings to locate its position; and yet it is
no uncommon occurrence for a ship to run
ashore in a fog. How much easier it is for a
submarine to lose its bearings when obliged to
travel by dead-reckoning, particularly in the
disconcerting excitement of the chase! To
avoid the danger of collision with surface vessels,
the commander chose to run at a depth of
sixty-five feet. That was the upper limit of his
safety-zone. A depth of over two hundred feet
was his lower limit, because, as stated before,
the water-pressure at that depth would crush in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
his hull or at least start its seams. If the bottom
were smooth and sandy, and not too deep,
he could settle gently upon it and wait for darkness,
to make his escape.</p>

<p>But while he lay on a sandy bottom, he was
still in danger. Trawlers were sweeping the
bottom with nets. He might be discovered;
and then if he did not come up and surrender,
a bomb would let in the sea upon him.</p>

<h3>A HINT FROM NATURE</h3>

<p>While he could not see under water, his adversaries
could. They had taken a hint from
nature. The fish-hawk has no difficulty in spying
his submarine prey. Flying high above the
water, he can see his victims at a considerable
depth, and wait his chance to pounce upon an
unwary fish that comes too near the surface.
It is said that the British trained sea-gulls to
hunt submarines. Sea-gulls will follow a ship
far out to sea for the sake of feeding on refuse
that is thrown overboard. British submarines
encouraged the birds to follow them, by throwing
out bait whenever they came to the surface.
Of course the birds could see the submarine
even when it was submerged, and if they pursued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
it, they were always rewarded with plenty
of food. The gulls drew no fine distinction
between Hun and Briton, and so it came that
<i>Herr Kommandant</i> often groped his way along
in the dark sea, totally oblivious of the fact that
he was attended by an escort of feathered folk
who kept the British chasers informed of his
presence.</p>

<p>In this connection it is interesting to note
that the British trained sea lions to hunt submarines.
The animals were taught at first to
swim to a friendly submarine, locating it by
the sound of its propellers. They were always
rewarded with fish. These sea lions were muzzled
so that they could not go fishing on their
own account. Then they learned to locate
enemy submarines and pointed them out by
swimming directly toward them and diving
down to them.</p>

<p>But there were human eyes, as well, that spied
upon the U-boat. Fast seaplanes patrolled the
waters, searching constantly for any trace of
submarine. Its form could be vaguely outlined
to a depth of from fifty to seventy-five feet,
unless the sea were choppy, and once it was discovered,
chasers or trawlers were signaled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
destroy it with bombs or to entangle it in nets.
Often a submarine would be discovered by a
leak in its oil-tank which would leave a tell-tale
trail. Sometimes when the U-boat itself
could not be discerned, there would be slight
shimmer, such as may be seen above a hot stove,
caused by refraction of light in its wake. This
was easily recognized by trained observers.</p>

<div class="caption0">A Depth-bomb Mortar in Action and a Depth-bomb snapped as it is being
hurled through the air</div></div>

<p>Even better aërial patrols were the small
dirigibles known as Blimps. They are a cross
between a balloon and an airplane, for they
have the body and the power-plant of an airplane,
but the planes are replaced by a gas-bag.
Blimps could cruise leisurely and search
the sea thoroughly. They could stop and hover
directly over a submarine and drop explosives
upon it with great accuracy. And so <i>Herr
Kommandant</i> could take no comfort in hiding
under a blanket of waves unless the blanket were
so thick as to conceal his form completely from
the eyes overhead. This made it imperative
to leave the shallower waters near shore and
push out into the deep sea, where the small
chasers could not pursue him. But he could
not shake off his pursuers. Stream-trawlers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
are built to ride the heaviest gales and they
took up the chase out into the ocean.</p>

<div class="caption0">Airplane Stunning a U-boat with a Depth-bomb</div></div>

<p>There was a decided advantage for the U-boat
in moving out to sea. It had a wider
field of activity and could more easily escape
from its pursuers. But on the other hand, its
prey also had an advantage. Out in the open
ocean they were not obliged to follow the usual
ship lanes and it was more difficult for a submarine
to intercept them. There it took more
U-boats to blockade a given area.</p>

<h3>A GAME OF HIDE-AND-SEEK</h3>

<p>Then, it ceased to be quite so one-sided a
game when merchantmen began to carry guns.
That made it necessary for the submarine commander
to creep up on his victims stealthily,
and depend upon his torpedoes. He had to
get within a thousand yards of the ship and
preferably within five hundred yards, in order
to be sure of hitting it. If the ship could travel
faster than he could, he had to do this without
betraying his presence. But ship-captains
soon learned that their safety lay in zig-zagging.
When <i>Herr Kommandant</i> reached the point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
from which he had planned to attack, he would
raise his telescopic periscope out of the water,
expecting to see his victim within good torpedo
range, only to find it sailing safely on another
tack. Again, he would have to take observations
and make another try, probably with no
better luck. It was a game of hide-and-seek
in which the merchant ship had a good chance
of making its escape, particularly when blotches
of camouflage paint made it difficult for him to
get the range, as described in Chapter XI.</p>

<div class="captionh0"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span> How a ship hid behind smoke produced on its own
stern, with different directions of wind</div></div>

<p>Slower ships could be attacked without all
this man&oelig;uvering, provided the submarine's
guns outranged those of the ship. And so U-boats
were provided with larger and larger
guns, which made it possible for them to stand
off and pound the merchantmen while out of
reach of the vessel's guns. But ships found a
way of hiding on the surface of the sea. A
vessel would spout forth volumes of dense black
smoke which would obliterate it from view.
(See <a href="#ip_262">Fig.&nbsp;19.</a>) If the wind was quartering,
the ship would change its course and dodge behind
the sheltering pall of smoke. Not only
was the smoke produced on the vessel itself,
but smoke-boxes were cast overboard to form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
a screen behind the vessel. These smoke-boxes
contained a mixture of coal-tar and phosphorus
and other chemicals which would produce
incomplete combustion. They were ignited
by the rubbing of a phosphorus compound
on a priming-composition, and then cast adrift
to pour out dense volumes of heavy smoke.
(See <a href="#ip_264">Fig.&nbsp;20.</a>) Behind this screen, the ship
could dodge and zig-zag and if her speed were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
greater than that of the submarine, her chances
of escape were very good.</p>

<div id="ip_264" class="figcenter" style="width: 331px;"><a href="images/i_264l.jpg">

<p>Another annoyance that <i>Herr Kommandant</i>
experienced was, when he lifted his periscopic
eye above water, to find it so smeared with a
sticky substance that he could not see. His
foes had strewn the water with tar-oil that had
spread in a thin film over a surface miles in
extent. This blinded him at first, but before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
long he was equipped with a jet for washing off
the periscope glass and that little annoyance
was overcome.</p>

<p>But the craft most dreaded by the U-boat
commander were the destroyers. These light,
high-powered, heavily armed vessels could
travel twice as fast as he could on the surface
and three times as fast as he could submerged.
Shells were invented which would not ricochet
from the surface of the sea, but would plow
right through the water, where they struck and
hit the submarine below water-level.</p>

<h3>DEATH-DEALING "ASH CANS"</h3>

<p>However, it was not shell-fire that he dreaded,
but the big "ash cans" loaded with TNT
which were timed to explode far under water,
and which would crush his boat or start its
seams. It was not necessary for these bombs
to hit the U-boat. When they went off they
would send out a wave of pressure that would
crush the boat or start its seams even if it were
a hundred feet and more from the point of the
explosion. Within limits, the deeper the explosion
the wider would its destructive area be.</p>

<p>The timing-mechanism of some depth bombs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
consisted merely of a float on the end of a cord.
When the bomb was thrown overboard this
float remained on the surface until the cord
was pulled out to its full length, when there
would be a yank on the firing-trigger and the
charge would explode. In other depth bombs
there was a valve operated by the pressure of
the water. When the bomb sank to the depth
for which the valve was set, the pressure of the
water would force the valve in, exploding a
cartridge which set off the charge. So powerful
were these depth bombs that the destroyer
had to travel at high speed to get out of range
of the explosion.</p>

<p>Depth bombs were rolled off the stern of the
destroyer and also thrown out from the sides
of the vessel by means of mortars. Some of
the mortars were Y-shaped and held a depth
bomb in each arm of the Y. When a blank 3-inch
shell was exploded at the base of the gun,
both bombs would be hurled from the ship, one
to port and the other to starboard. In this way
the destroyer could drop the bombs in a "pattern"
of wide area. <i>Herr Kommandant</i> gained
a wholesome respect for these terriers of the
sea. It was suicide to show himself anywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
near a destroyer. In a moment the speedy boat
would be upon him, sowing depth bombs along
his course. His chances of escaping through
this hail of high explosives were remote indeed.</p>

<p>The ships that he was most eager to destroy
were either too speedy for him to catch, unless
they happened to come his way, or else they
were herded in large convoys protected by these
dreaded destroyers. The convoy proved a most
baffling problem for <i>Herr Kommandant</i>. He
dared not attack the convoy by daylight. In a
fog he might take a chance at picking off one
of the ships, but even that was very risky. He
could trail the convoy until dusk and then under
cover of darkness draw near enough to discharge
a torpedo, but in the daytime he must
keep his distance because there were eyes in the
sky watching for him. At the van and rear of
the convoy there were kite balloons high in the
sky, with observers constantly watching for
periscopes, and for U-boats that might be lurking
under the surface.</p>

<p>As the destroyers gained in experience, the
difficulties of the U-boat attack grew greater
and its work grew more and more perilous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
The crew grumbled and grew mutinous. The
morale of the men was shaken. We can
imagine the horror of plunging hurriedly into
the depths of the sea, and rushing along blindly
under the surface, dodging this way and that,
while terrific explosions of depth bombs stagger
the submarine and threaten to crush it, and
there is the constant expectation that the next
explosion will tear the thin shell of the U-boat
and let in the black hungry water. The tables
were turned. Now, if never before, <i>Herr Kommandant</i>,
the hunter, knew what it felt like to
be hunted.</p>

<p>It takes an exceptional man to go through
such a harrowing experience with unshattered
nerves. On at least one occasion, a submarine
that was being depth-bombed came suddenly to
the surface. The hatch flew open and the crew
rushed out, holding up their hands and crying,
"<i>Kamerad</i>." The U-boat was uninjured, but
the shock of a depth bomb explosion had put
the electric-lighting system out of commission,
and the crew, unnerved by the explosion and terrified
by the darkness, had overpowered their
officers and brought the boat to the surface.</p>

<h3>EYES IN THE SEA</h3>

<p>There were other craft that <i>Herr Kommandant</i>
had to look out for. His were not the only
submarines in the sea. His foes also were
possessed of submarines. They could not see
under water any better than he could, but they
could fight on the surface as well as he, and
they could creep up on him even as he crept
up on his prey. As a French submarine commander
puts it: "The U-boats used to enjoy
the advantage of remaining themselves invisible
while all the surface and aërial craft which were
sent in pursuit of them were boldly outlined
against the sky and visible to them. This is
one of the reasons we used submarines to ambush
U-boats." Submarines were also used to
accompany the convoys, so that the U-boat commander
had to watch not only for the eyes
of the ship's lookouts and the eyes in the kite
balloons, but also for the periscope eyes that
swam in the sea.</p>

<h3>TRAILING U-BOATS BY SOUND</h3>

<p>The troubles of the submarine-commander
were multiplying. All over the world inventors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
were plotting his destruction. As long as we
depended upon our eyes to ferret him out, the
sea was a safe refuge, provided he dived deep
enough, but when we began to use our ears as
well, he found himself in a very serious predicament.
Although light is badly broken up in its
passage through water, sound-waves will travel
through water much better than in air. The
first listening-devices used were crude affairs
and did not amount to much, particularly when
the U-boats muffled their motors and engines
so that they were virtually noiseless. But the
French invented a very sensitive sound-detector.
It consisted of a lot of tiny diaphragms
set in a big hemisphere. There were two of
these hemispheres, one at each side of the boat.
When sound-waves struck these hemispheres,
the diaphragms would respond. At the focus
of each hemisphere there was a megaphone receiver;
one of these carried the sound to the
operator's right ear and the other to his left.
He would turn a megaphone around until he
found the diaphragm that produced the loudest
sound. This gave him the direction of the
sound-wave. Then the boat would be steered
in that direction. He knew that it was aimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
properly when the sound coming to his right ear
was just as loud as that which came into his left
ear.</p>

<p>A still better hydrophone was developed by a
group of American inventors. The details of
this cannot yet be disclosed, but we know that
it was adopted at once by our allies. A very
sensitive receiver was used which could detect
a U-boat miles away and determine its direction
accurately. Under ideal conditions the range
of the device was from fifteen to twenty-five
miles, but the average was from three to eight
miles. If two or more boats fitted with sound-detectors
were used, they could determine the
position of the U-boat perfectly. One drawback
was that the vessel would have to stop
so that the noise of its own engines would not
disturb the listener, but this was largely overcome
by trailing the detector a hundred feet
or more from the stem of the ship. The sounds
were then brought in by an electric cable to the
listener in the ship.</p>

<p>These sound-detectors were placed on Allied
submarines as well as surface vessels and they
were actually tried out on balloons and dirigibles,
so that they could follow a U-boat after it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
had submerged too deeply to be followed by
sight.</p>

<div id="ip_272" class="figcenter" style="width: 334px;"><a href="images/i_272l.jpg">

<p>Many U-boats were chased to their doom by
the aid of the American hydrophone. Fig. 21
illustrates a very dramatic chase. The full
line shows the course of the U-boat as plotted
out by hydrophones and the broken line the
course of the submarine-chasers. The dots represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
patterns of depth bombs dropped upon
the U-boat. Try as he would, the <i>Herr Kommandant</i>
could not shake off his pursuers. At
one time, as the listeners stopped to take observations,
they heard hammering in the U-boat
as if repairs were being made. The motors of
the submarine would start and stop, showing
clearly that it was disabled. More depth bombs
were dropped and then there was perfect
silence, which was soon broken by twenty-five
revolver-shots. Evidently the crew, unable to
come to the surface, had given up in despair
and committed suicide.</p>

<div class="caption0">A Paravane hauled up with a Shark caught in its jaws</div></div>

<p>The Adriatic Sea was an ideal place for the
use of the hydrophone. The water there is so
deep that submarines dared not rest on the
bottom, but had to keep moving, and so they
could easily be followed. Across the sea, at the
heel of the boot of Italy, a barrage of boats
was established. U-boats would come down to
this barrage at night and, when within two or
three miles of the boats, dive and pass under
them. But when hydrophones were used that
game proved very hazardous. Our listeners
would hear them coming when they were miles
away. Then they would hear them shift from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
oil-to electric-drive and plunge under the surface.
Darkness was no protection to the U-boats.
The sound-detector worked just as well
at night as in the daytime and a group of three
boats would drop a pattern of bombs that would
send the U-boat to the bottom.</p>

<p>On one occasion after an attack it was evident
that the submarine had been seriously injured.
Its motors were operating, but something must
have gone wrong with its steering-gear, or its
ballast-chambers may have been flooded, because
it kept going down and soon the listeners
heard a crunching noise as it was crushed by
the tremendous pressure of the water.</p>

<p>And so U-boat warfare grew more and more
terrible for <i>Herr Kommandant</i>. The depths of
the sea were growing even more dangerous than
the surface. On every hand he was losing out.
He had tried to master the sea without mastering
the surface of the sea. But he can never
really master who dares not fight out in the
open. For a time, the German did prevail, but
his adversaries were quick to see his deficiencies
and, by playing upon these, to rob the terror
of the sea of his powers. And as <i>Herr Kommandant</i>
looks back at the time when he stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
into the lime-light as the most brutal destroyer
the world has ever seen, he cannot take much
satisfaction in reflecting that the sum total of
his efforts was to spread hatred of Germany
throughout the world, to summon into the conflict
a great nation whose armies turned the tide
of victory against his soldiers, and finally to
subject his navy, second only to that of Great
Britain, to the most humiliating surrender the
world has ever seen.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> modern warfare a duel between fixed forts
and floating forts is almost certain to end
in a draw. Because the former are fixed they
make good targets, while the war-ship, being
able to move about, can dodge the shell that are
fired against it. On the other hand, a fort on
land can stand a great deal of pounding and
each of its guns must be put out of action individually,
before it is subdued, while the fort
that is afloat runs the risk of being sunk with
a few well-directed shots.</p>

<p>But fortifications alone will not protect a
harbor from a determined enemy. They cannot
prevent hostile ships from creeping by them
under cover of darkness or a heavy fog. To
prevent this, the harbor must be mined, and this
must be done in such a way that friendly shipping
can be piloted through the mine-field,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
while hostile craft will be sure to strike the
mines and be destroyed.</p>

<p>The mines may be arranged to be fired by
electricity from shore stations, in which case
they are anchored at such a depth that ships
can sail over them without touching them. If a
hostile vessel tried to dash into the harbor, the
touch of a button on shore would sink it when
it passed over one of the mines. But the success
of electrically fired mines would depend
upon the "seeing." In a heavy fog they would
prove no protection.</p>

<p>Another way of using electric mines is to
have telltale devices which a ship would strike
and which would indicate to the operator on
shore that a vessel was riding over the mines
and would also let him know over which particular
mines it was at the moment passing.
No friendly vessel would undertake to enter
the harbor in a fog or after dark and the operator
would not hesitate to blow up the invader
even if he could not see him.</p>

<p>However, the ordinary method of mining a
harbor is to lay fields of anchored mines across
the channels and entrances to the harbor&mdash;sensitive
mines that will blow up at the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
touch of a ship's hull&mdash;and leave tortuous
passages through the fields for friendly shipping.
Of course pilots have to guide the ships
through the passages and lest enemy spies learn
just where the openings are the mine-fields
must be shifted now and then.</p>

<p>The mines are, therefore, made so that they
can be taken up by friendly mine-sweepers who
know just how to handle them, and planted elsewhere.
These are defensive mines, but there
are other mines that are not intended to be
moved. They are planted in front of enemy
harbors to block enemy shipping and they are
made so sensitive or of such design that they
will surely explode if tampered with.</p>

<h3>THE MINE THAT DOES ITS OWN SOUNDING</h3>

<p>A favorite type of mine used during the war
was one which automatically adjusted itself to
sink to the desired depth. Submerged mines
are more dangerous to the enemy because they
cannot be seen and avoided. They should float
far enough under the surface to remain hidden
and yet not so deep that a shallow-draft ship
can pass over them without hitting them. As
the sea bottom may be very irregular, it is impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
to tell how long the anchor cable should
be without sounding the depth of the water at
every point at which a mine is planted. But
the automatic anchor takes care of this. Very
ingeniously it does its own sounding and holds
the mine down to the depth for which it is set.
The mine cable is wound up on a reel in the
anchor and the mine is held fast to the anchor
by a latch. The anchor is of box-shape or
cylindrical form, with perforations in it. At
first it sinks comparatively slowly, but as it
fills with water it goes down faster. Attached
to the anchor is a plummet or weight, connected
by a cord to the latch. The length of this cord
determines the depth at which the mine will
float.</p>

<div class="caption0"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span> How the mine automatically adjusts itself to various
depths of water</div></div>

<p>The operation of the mine is shown in <a href="#ip_279">Fig.&nbsp;22</a>.
When it is thrown overboard (1) it immediately
turns over so that the buoyant mine
<i>A</i> floats on the surface (2). While the anchor
is slowly filling and sinking, the plummet <i>B</i>
runs out (3). If the mines are to float at a
depth of, say, ten feet, this cord must be ten
feet long. As soon as it runs out to its full
length (4) it springs a latch, <i>C</i>, releasing the
mine <i>A</i>. Then the mine cable <i>D</i> pays out, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
the anchor <i>E</i> sinks, until the plummet <i>B</i> strikes
bottom (5). As soon as the plummet cord
slackens a spring-pressed pawl is released and
locks the mine-cable reel, so that as the anchor
continues to sink it draws the mine down with
it, until it touches bottom (6), and as the anchor
was ten feet from the bottom when the plummet
touched bottom and locked the reel, the mine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
must necessarily be dragged down to a depth
of ten feet below the surface.</p>

<p>The mine itself, or the "devil's egg" as it
is called, is usually a big buoyant sphere of
metal filled with TNT or some other powerful
explosive; and projecting from it are a
number of very fragile prongs which if broken
or even cracked will set off the mine. There
is a safety-lever or pin that makes the mine
harmless when it is being handled, and this
must be withdrawn just before the mine is to
be launched. In some mines the prongs are
little plungers that are withdrawn into the
mine-shell and held by a cement which softens
after the mine is submerged and lets the
plungers spring out. When the plungers are
broken, water enters and, coming in contact
with certain chemicals, produces enough heat to
set off a cartridge which fires the mine.</p>

<h3>PICKING INFERNAL MACHINES OUT OF THE SEA</h3>

<p>The enemy mine-fields were often located
by seaplanes and then mine-sweepers had to
undertake the extremely hazardous task of raising
the mines or destroying them. If they
were of the offensive type, it was much better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
to destroy them. But occasionally, when conditions
permitted, mine-sweepers undertook to
raise the mines and reclaim them for future use
against the enemy. The work of seizing a mine
and making it fast to the hoisting-cable of the
mine-sweeper was usually done from a small
rowboat. Raising the first mine was always
the most perilous undertaking, because no one
knew just what type of mine it was and how to
handle it with safety, or whether there was any
way in which it <i>could</i> be made harmless. There
were some mines, for instance, that contained
within them a small vial partly filled with
sulphuric acid. The mine carried no prongs,
but if it were tilted more than twenty degrees
the acid would spill out and blow up the mine.
Such a mine would be exceedingly difficult if
not impossible to handle from a boat that was
rocked about by the waves.</p>

<p>After the first mine of the field was raised
and its safety-mechanism studied, the task of
raising the rest was not so dangerous. A
water telescope was used to locate the mine and
to aid in hooking the hoisting-cable into the
shackle on the mine. The hook was screwed
to the end of a pole and after the mine was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
hooked, the pole was unscrewed and the cable
hauled in, bringing up the "devil's egg"
bristling with death. Care had to be taken to
keep the bobbing boat from touching the delicate
prongs until the safety-device could be
set.</p>

<p>However, this painstaking and careful
method of raising mines was not often employed.
Shallow-draft mine-sweepers would
run over the mine-field, dragging a cable between
them. The cable would be kept down by
means of hydrovanes or "water kites" deep
enough to foul the anchor cables of the mines.
The "water kites" were V-shaped structures
that were connected to the cable in such a way
that they would nose down as they were
dragged through the water and carry the cable
under. The action is just the reverse of a kite,
which is set to nose up into the wind and carry
the kite up when it is dragged through the air.
By means of the cable the anchor chain of the
mine was caught and then the mine with its
anchor was dragged up. If the mine broke
loose from its anchor it could be exploded with
a rifle-shot if it did not automatically explode
on fouling the cable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>

<h3>FLOATING MINES</h3>

<p>When England entered the war she mined her
harbors because, although she had the mastery
of the sea, she had to guard against raids of
enemy ships carried out in foggy and dark
weather. But the mines were no protection
against submarines. They would creep along
the bottom under the mines. Then cable nets
were stretched across the harbor channels to
bar the submarines, but the U-boats were
fitted with cutters which would tear through
the nets, and it became necessary to use mines
set at lower depths so that the submarines could
not pass under them; and nets were furnished
with bombs which would explode when fouled
by submarines. In fact, mines were set adrift
with nets stretched between them, to trap submarines.
Floating mines were also used by the
Germans for the destruction of surface vessels
and these were usually set adrift in pairs, with
a long cable connecting them, so that if a vessel
ran into the cable the mines would be dragged
in against its hull and blow it up.</p>

<p>The laws of war require that floating mines be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
of such a design that they will become inoperative
in a few hours; otherwise they might drift
about for weeks or months or years and be a
constant menace to shipping. Sometimes
anchored mines break away from their moorings
and are carried around by ocean currents
or are blown about by the winds. A year
after the Russo-Japanese War a ship was
blown up by striking a mine that had been torn
from its anchorage and had drifted far from
the field in which it was planted. No doubt
there are hundreds of mines afloat in the
Atlantic Ocean which for many years to come
will hold out the threat of sudden destruction
to ocean vessels; for the Germans knew no laws
of war and had no scruples against setting
adrift mines that would remain alive until they
were eaten up with rust.</p>

<div class="caption0"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span> Ocean currents of the North Atlantic showing the
probable path of drifting mines</div></div>

<p>The chart on the next page shows the course
of ocean currents in the North Atlantic as
plotted out by the Prince of Monaco, from which
it may be seen that German mines will probably
make a complete circuit of the North
Atlantic, drifting down the western coast of
Europe, across the Atlantic, around the Azores,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
and into the Gulf Stream, which will carry them
back to the North Sea, only to start all over.
(See <a href="#ip_285">Fig.&nbsp;23.</a>) Some of them will run up into
the Arctic Ocean, where they will be blown up
by striking icebergs and many will be trapped
in the mass of floating
seaweed in the Sargasso
Sea. But many years
will pass before all danger
of mines will be removed.
In the meantime, the war has left a
tremendous amount of work to be done in raising
anchored mines and destroying them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span></p>

<h3>EGG-LAYING SUBMARINES</h3>

<p>Early in the war the British were astonished
to find enemy mine-fields in their own waters,
far from any German ports. They could not
have been planted by surface mine-layers, unless
these had managed to creep up disguised
as peaceful trawlers. This seemed hardly
likely, because these fields appeared in places
that were well guarded. Then it was discovered
that German U-boats were doing this
work. Special mine-laying U-boats had been
built and one of them was captured with its
cargo of "devil's eggs."</p>

<p>A sectional view of the mine-laying U-boat
is shown opposite page <a href="#Page_272">272</a>. In the after part
of the boat were mine-chutes in each of which
three mines were stored. A mine-laying submarine
would carry about a score of mines.
These could be released one at a time. The
mine with its anchor would drop to the bottom.
As soon as it struck, anchor-arms would be
tripped and spread out to catch in the sand or
mud, while the mine cable would be released
and the mine would rise as far as the cable
would allow it. The U-boat commander would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
have to know the depth of water in which
the mines were to be laid and adjust the cables
to this depth in advance. This could not be
done while the U-boat was submerged. With
the mines all set for the depth at a certain spot,
the U-boat commander had to find that very
spot to lay his "eggs," otherwise they would
either lie too deep to do any harm to shipping,
or else they would reach up to the surface,
where they might be discovered by the Allied
patrols. As he had to do his navigating blindly,
by dead-reckoning, it was very difficult for him
to locate his mine-fields properly.</p>

<p>But the Germans did not have a monopoly
on submarine mine-laying. The British also
laid mines by submarine within German harbors
and channels, right under the guns of
Heligoland, and many a U-boat was destroyed
by such mines within its home waters.</p>

<div class="caption0">A Dutch Mine-sweeper engaged in clearing the North Sea of German Mines</div></div>

<h3>PARAVANES</h3>

<p>On the other hand, the Allies had a way of
sailing right through fields of enemy mines
with little danger. Our ships were equipped
with "paravanes" which are something like
the "water kites" used by mine-sweepers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
they are still used in the waters of the war zone.
Paravanes are steel floats with torpedo-shaped
bodies and a horizontal plane near the forward
end. At the tail of the paravane, there
are horizontal and vertical rudders which can be
set to make the device run out from the side of
the vessel that is towing it, and at the desired
depth below the surface. Two paravanes are
used, one at each side of the ship, and the towing-cables
lead from the bow of the vessel.
Thus there are two taut cables that run out
from the ship in the form of a V and at such a
depth that they will foul the mooring-cable of
any mine that might be encountered. The mine
cable slides along the paravane cable and in
this way is carried clear of the ship's hull.
When it reaches the paravane it is caught in a
sharp-toothed jaw which cuts the mine cable and
lets the mine bob up to the surface. The mine
is then exploded by rifle or machine-gun fire.</p>

<div id="ip_289" class="figcenter" style="width: 364px;">
  <img src="images/i_289.jpg" width="364" height="493" alt="" /><br />
  <div class="captionl">Courtesy of "Scientific American"</div>

<div class="caption0">Hooking Up Enemy Anchored Mines</div></div>

<p>In some forms of paravane there is a hinged
jaw which is operated from the ship to shear the
cable. The jaw is repeatedly opened and
closed by a line that runs to a winch on the ship.
This winch winds up the line until it is taut
and then the line is permitted to slip, letting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
the jaw open, only to close again as the winch
keeps on turning and winding up the line.</p>

<p>Guarded by steel sharks on each side, their
jaws constantly working, a ship can plow right
through a field of anchored mines with little
danger. To be sure, the bow might chance to
hit a mine, when, of course, there would be an
explosion; but the ship could stand damage here
better than anywhere else and unless the bow
actually hit the mine, one or other of the paravanes
would take care of it and keep it from
being dragged in against the hull of the vessel.</p>

<h3>PENNING IN THE U-BOATS</h3>

<p>According to German testimony, mines were
responsible for the failure of the U-boat. However,
it was not merely the scattered mine-fields
sown in German waters that brought the
U-boat to terms, but an enormous mine-field
stretching across the North Sea from the Orkney
Islands to the coast of Norway. Early in the
war, U-boats had been prevented from entering
the English Channel by nets and mines stretched
across the Straits of Dover. As the submarine
menace grew, it was urged that a similar net
be stretched across the North Sea to pen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
U-boats in. But it seemed like a stupendous
task. The distance across at the narrowest
point is nearly two hundred and fifty miles.
It would not have been necessary to have the
net come to the surface. It could just as well
have been anchored so that its upper edge
would be covered with thirty feet of water.
Surface vessels could then have sailed over it
without trouble and submarines could not have
passed over it without showing themselves to
patrolling destroyers. It would not have been
necessary to carry the net to the bottom of the
sea. A belt of netting a hundred and fifty feet
wide would have made an effective bar to the
passage of U-boats. As U-boats might cut their
way through the net, it was proposed to mount
bombs or mines on them which would explode on
contact and destroy any submarine that tried to
pass. However, laying a net two hundred feet
long even when it is laid in sections, is no small
job, but when the net is loaded with contact
mines, the difficulty of the work may be well
imagined.</p>

<p>And yet had it been thought that the net would
be a success it would have been laid anyhow,
but it was argued that seaweed would clog the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
meshes of the net and ocean currents would tear
gaps in it. Even if it had not been torn away,
the tidal currents would have swept it down and
borne it under so far that U-boats could have
passed over it in safety without coming to the
surface.</p>

<h3>A WALL OF MINES</h3>

<p>When America entered the war, we were very
insistent that something must be done to block
the North Sea, and we proposed that a barrage
of anchored mines be stretched across the sea
and that these mines be set at different levels
so as to make a "wall" that submarines could
not dive under. This would do away with all
the drawbacks of a net. Ocean currents and
masses of seaweed could not affect individual
mines as they would a net. Furthermore, an
American inventor had devised a new type of
mine which was peculiarly adapted to the proposed
mine barrage. It had a firing-mechanism
that was very sensitive and the mine
had twice the reach of any other.</p>

<p>At length the British mine-laying forces were
prevailed upon to join with us in laying this
enormous mine. It was one of the biggest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
most successful undertakings of the war. It
was to be two hundred and thirty miles long
and twelve miles wide on the average, reaching
from the rocky shores of the Orkney Islands
to Norway. There was plenty of deep water
close to the coast of Norway and it was against
international law to lay mines within three miles
of the shores of a neutral nation, so that the U-boats
might have had a clear passage around the
end of the barrage. But as it was also against
the law for the U-boats to sail through neutral
waters, Norway laid a mine-field off its coast
to enforce neutrality, and this was to join with
that which the British and we were to lay.
Most of the mine-laying was to be done by the
United States and we were to furnish the mines.</p>

<p>The order to proceed with the work was given
in October, 1917, and it was a big order. A
hundred thousand mines were to be made and to
preserve secrecy, as well as to hurry the work
as much as possible, it was divided among five
hundred contractors and subcontractors. The
parts were put together in one plant and then
sent to another, where each mine was filled with
three hundred pounds of molten TNT. To
carry them across the ocean small steamers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
were used, so that if one should be blown up
by a submarine the loss of mines would not be
very great. There were twenty-four of these
steamers, each carrying from twelve hundred to
eighteen hundred mines and only one of them
was destroyed by a submarine. The steamers
delivered their loads on the west coast of Scotland
and the mines were taken across to the
east coast by rail and motor canal-boats. Here
the mines were finally assembled, ready for
planting. Seventy thousand mines were
planted, four fifths of them by American mine-layers
and the rest by the British.</p>

<h3>MINE RAILROADS ON SHIPS</h3>

<p>To handle the mines the ships were specially
fitted with miniature railroads for transporting
the mines to the launching-point, so that they
could be dropped at regular intervals without
interruption. Each anchor mine was provided
with flanged wheels that ran on rails. The
mines were carried on three decks and each
deck was covered with a network of rails,
switches, and turn-tables, while elevators were
provided to carry the mines from one deck to
another. The mines, like miniature railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
cars, were coupled up in trains of thirty or forty
and as each mine weighed fourteen hundred
pounds, steam winches had to be used to haul
them. At the launching-point the tracks ran out
over the stern of the boat and here a trap was
provided which would hold only one mine at a
time. By the pulling of a lever the jaws of the
trap would open and the mine would slide off the
rails and plunge into the sea.</p>

<p>The mines were dropped every three hundred
feet in lines five hundred feet apart, as it was
unsafe for the mine-layers to steam any closer
to one another than that. The mines were of
the type shown in <a href="#ip_279">Fig.&nbsp;22</a> and automatically
adjusted themselves to various depths. The
depth of the water ran down to twelve hundred
feet near the Norwegian coast. Never before
had mines been planted at anywhere near that
depth.</p>

<p>It was dangerous work, because the enemy
knew where the mines were being planted, as
neutral shipping had to be warned months in advance.
The mine-layers were in constant
danger of submarine attack, although they were
convoyed by destroyers to take care of the
U-boats. There was even danger of a surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
attack and so battle-cruisers were assigned the
job of guarding the mine-layers. The mine-layers
steamed in line abreast, and had one of
them been blown up, the shock would probably
have been enough to blow up the others as well.
Enemy mines were sown in the path of the
mine-layers, so the latter had to be preceded by
mine-sweepers. Navigation buoys had to be
planted at the ends of the lines of mines and the
enemy had a habit of planting mines near the
buoys or of moving the buoys whenever he had
a chance. But despite all risks the work was
carried through.</p>

<p>The barrier was not an impassable one. With
the mines three hundred feet apart, a submarine
might get through, even though the field was
twenty-five miles broad, but the hazards were
serious. Before the first lines of mines had been
extended half-way across, its value was demonstrated
by the destruction of several U-boats,
and as the safety-lane was narrowed down the
losses increased. It is said that altogether
twenty-three German submarines met their
doom in the great mine barrage. U-boat commanders
balked at running through it, and
U-boat warfare virtually came to a standstill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
According to Captain Bartenbach, commander
of submarine bases in Flanders, three U-boats
were sunk by anchored mines for every one that
was destroyed by a depth bomb.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Surface Boats</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> war on the submarine was fought
mainly from the surface of the sea and
from the air above the sea, and naturally it
resulted in many interesting naval developments.</p>

<p>As described in Chapter XIII, the first offensive
measure against the U-boat was the building
of swarms of speedy motor-boats which
drove the invaders away from harbors and into
the open sea. To follow the U-boats out into
rough water larger submarine-chasers were
built, but even they could not cope with the
enemy far from the harbors.</p>

<h3>MOTOR TORPEDO-BOATS</h3>

<p>The Italians made excellent use of speedy
motor-boats in the protected waters of the Adriatic
Sea. One type of motor-boat was equipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
with two torpedo-tubes in the bow. Small 14-inch
torpedoes were used, but as each torpedo
carried two hundred pounds of high explosive,
the motor-boat was a formidable vessel if it
crept in close enough to discharge one of these
missiles at its foe.</p>

<p>On one occasion, a patrol of these little boats
sighted a couple of Austrian dreadnoughts
headed down the coast, surrounded by a screen
of ten destroyers. Favored by the mist, two of
the motor-boats crept through the screen of destroyers,
and torpedoed the battle-ships. Then
they made good their escape. A destroyer that
pursued one of the boats decided that the game
was not worth while when it was suddenly
shaken up by the explosion of a depth bomb
dropped from the motor-boat.</p>

<h3>THE SEA TANK</h3>

<p>The Italians showed a great deal of naval initiative.
They were forever trying to trap the
Austrian fleet or to invade its harbors. Like
all other naval powers, the Austrians protected
their harbors with nets and mines. It was impossible
for submarines to make an entrance and
the ports were too well fortified to permit an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
open attack on the surface. Nevertheless, the
Italians did break through the harbor defenses
on one or two occasions and sank Austrian war-vessels.
Again it was with a small boat that
they did the trick.</p>

<p>The nets which the Austrians stretched across
their harbor entrance were supported on wooden
booms or logs which served as floats. These
booms offered an effective bar to small boats
which might attempt to enter the harbor under
cover of darkness. But the Italians found a
way to overcome this obstruction. They built
a flat-bottomed motor-boat which drew very
little water. Running under the boat were two
endless chains, like the treads of a tank. In
fact, the boat came to be known as a "sea tank."
The chains were motor-driven and had spiked
sprockets, so that when a boom was encountered
they would bite into the wood and pull the boat
up over the log, or maybe they would drag the
log down under the boat. At any rate, with this
arrangement it was not very difficult to pass the
boom and enter the harbor. At the rear the
chains were carried back far enough to prevent
the propeller from striking when the boat had
passed over the log.</p>

<h3>THE AWKWARD "EAGLES"</h3>

<p>A curious boat that we undertook to furnish
during the war was a cross between a destroyer
and a submarine-chaser. After the submarine
had been driven out to sea its greatest foe was
undoubtedly the destroyer, and frantic efforts
were made to turn out as many destroyers as
possible. But it takes time to build destroyers
and so a new type of boat was designed, to be
turned out quickly in large numbers. A hundred
and ten "Eagles" (as these boats are
called) were ordered, but the armistice was
signed before any of them were put into service;
and it is just as well that such was the case, for
in their construction everything was sacrificed
to speed of production. As a consequence they
are very ugly boats, with none of the fine lines
of a destroyer, and they roll badly, even when
the sea is comparatively peaceful. They are
five-hundred-ton boats designed to make eighteen
knots, which would not have been fast
enough to cope with U-boats, because the latter
could make as high a speed as that themselves,
when traveling on the surface, and the two
4-inch guns of the Eagles would have been far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
outranged by the 5.9-inch guns of the larger
U-boats.</p>

<h3>SEAPLANE TOWING-BARGES</h3>

<p>When the war on the U-boat was carried up
into the sky, many new naval problems cropped
up, particularly when German submarines
chose to work far out at sea. Big seaplanes
were used, but they consumed a great deal of
fuel in flying out and back, cutting down by just
so much their flying-radius at the scene of activities.
A special towing-barge was used. These
barges had trimming-tanks aft, which could be
flooded so that the stern of the barge would submerge.
A cradle was mounted to run on a pair
of rails on the barge. The body of the seaplane
was lashed to this cradle and then drawn up on
the barge by means of a windlass. This done,
the water was blown out of the trimming-tanks
by means of compressed air and the barge was
brought up to an even keel. The barge with
its load was now ready to be towed by a destroyer
or other fast boat to the scene of operations.
There water was again let into the
trimming-tanks and the seaplane was let back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
into the water. From the water the seaplane
arose into the air in the usual way.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when the sea is at all rough
it is exceedingly difficult for a seaplane to take
wing, particularly a large seaplane. A better
starting-platform than the sea had to be furnished.
At first some seaplanes were furnished
with wheels, so that they could be launched from
platforms on large ships; and then, to increase
the flying-radius, seaplanes were discarded in
favor of airplanes. Once these machines were
launched, there was no way for them to get
back to the ship. They had to get back to land
before their fuel was exhausted.</p>

<p>On the large war-vessels a starting-platform
was built on a pair of long guns. Then the
war-ship would head into the wind and the combined
travel of the ship and of the airplane
along the platform gave speed enough to raise
the plane off the platform before it had run the
full length of the guns. But as long as aviators
had no haven until they got back to land, there
were many casualties. Eager to continue their
patrol as long as possible, they would sometimes
linger too long before heading for home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
and then they would not have enough fuel left
to reach land. Many an aviator was lost in this
way, and finally mother-ships for airplanes had
to be built.</p>

<h3>THE "HUSH SHIPS"</h3>

<p>The British Navy had constructed a number of
very fast cruisers to deal with any raiders the
Germans might send out. These cruisers were
light vessels capable of such high speeds that
they could even overtake a destroyer. They
were 840 feet long and their turbines developed
90,000 horse-power. The construction of these
vessels was for a long time kept a profound
secret and it was not until the German fleet
surrendered that photographs of them were allowed
to be published. Because of this secrecy
the boats were popularly known as "hush ships."
They were not armored; it was not
necessary to load them down with armor plate,
because their protection lay in speed and they
were designed to fight at very long range. In
fact, they were to carry guns that would outrange
those of the most powerful dreadnoughts.
Our largest naval guns are of 16-inch caliber,
but the "hush ships" were each to carry two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
<i>18-inch guns</i>. The guns were monsters weighing
150 tons each and they fired a shell 18 inches
in diameter and 7 feet long to a distance of 30
miles when elevated to an angle of 45 degrees.
The weight of the shell was 3600 pounds and it
carried 500 pounds of high explosive or more
than is carried in the largest torpedoes.</p>

<p>At the 32-mile range the shell would pass
through 12 inches of face-hardened armor and
at half that range it would pass through armor
18 inches thick, and there is no armor afloat any
heavier than this.</p>

<div class="caption0">Hauling a Seaplane up on a Barge so that it may be Towed at High Speed by a Destroyer</div></div>

<h3>MOTHER-BOATS FOR AIRPLANES</h3>

<p>Armed with such powerful guns as these, the
"hush ships" would have been very formidable
indeed; but when the guns were mounted on one
of the cruisers, the <i>Furious</i>, they were found
too powerful for the vessel. It was evident that
the monsters would very seriously rack their
own ship. So the guns were taken off the
cruiser and it was turned into a mother-ship
for airplanes. A broad, unobstructed deck was
built on the ship which provided a runway from
which airplanes could be launched, and this runway
was actually broad enough to permit airplanes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
to land upon it. Under the runway were
the hangars in which the airplanes were housed.
Other "hush ships" were also converted into
airplane mother-boats and there were special
boats built for this very purpose, although they
were not able to make the speed of the "hush
ships." One of these special boats had funnels
that turned horizontally to carry off the furnace
smoke over the stern and leave a perfectly clear
flying-deck, 330 feet long.</p>

<h3>TORPEDO-PROOF MONSTERS</h3>

<p>As for the 18-inch guns, they were put to another
use. Early in the war the British had
need for powerful shallow-draft vessels which
could operate off the Flanders coast and attack
the coast fortifications that were being built by
the Germans. The ships that were built to
meet this demand were known as monitors, because
like the famous "monitor" of our Civil
War they carried a single turret. These monitors
were very broad for their length and were
very slow. At best they could make only seven
knots and in heavy weather they could not make
more than two or three knots.</p>

<p>To be made proof against torpedoes these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
boats were formed with "blisters" or hollow
rounded swells in the hull at each side which
extended out to a distance of twelve to fifteen
feet. The blisters were subdivided into compartments,
so that if a torpedo struck the ship
it would explode against a blister at a considerable
distance from the real hull of the ship and
the force of the explosion would be expended
in the compartments. The blisters were the
salvation of the monitors. Often were the boats
struck by torpedoes without being sunk.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this form of protection could
not be applied to ordinary vessels, because it
would have interfered seriously with navigation.
The blisters made the monitors very difficult
to steer and hampered the progress of a ship,
particularly in a seaway.</p>

<p>With ships such as these the British bombarded
Zeebrugge from a distance of twenty to
twenty-five miles. Of course, the range had to
be plotted out mathematically, as the target was
far beyond the horizon of the ship, and the
firing had to be directed by spotters in airplanes.</p>

<p>At first guns from antiquated battle-ships
were used in the monitors; then larger guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
were used, until finally two of the monitors inherited
the 18-inch guns of the <i>Furious</i>. A
single gun was mounted on the after deck of each
vessel and the gun was arranged to fire only
on the starboard side. No heavily armored
turret was provided, but merely a light housing
to shelter the gun.</p>

<h3>AN ELECTRICALLY STEERED MOTOR-BOAT</h3>

<p>The British war-vessels that operated in the
shallow waters off the coast of Flanders were a
constant source of annoyance to the Germans.
Because of the shallow water it was seldom possible
for a submarine to creep up on them. A
U-boat required at least thirty-five feet of water
for complete submergence and it did not dare
to attack in the open. This led the Germans to
launch a motor-boat loaded with high explosive,
which was steered from shore. The motor-boat
carried a reel of wire which connected it
with an operator on shore. There was no pilot
in the boat, but the helm was controlled electrically
by the man at the shore station. As it
was difficult for the helmsman to see just what
his boat was doing, or just how to steer it when
it was several miles off, an airplane flew high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
above it and directed the helmsman, by radiotelegraphy,
how to steer his boat. Of course,
radiotelegraphy might have been used to
operate the steering-mechanism of the boat,
but there was the danger that the radio operators
of the British might send out disturbing
waves that would upset the control of the motor-boat,
and so direct wire transmission was used
instead. Fortunately, when the Germans tried
this form of attack, an alert British lookout discovered
the tiny motor-boat. The alarm was
given and a lucky shot blew up the boat with
its charge before it came near the British vessel.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Reclaiming the Victims of the Submarine</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Nearly</span> fifteen million tons of shipping lie
at the bottom of the sea, sunk by German
U-boats, and the value of these ships with their
cargo is estimated at over seven billion dollars.
In one year, 1917, the loss was nearly a million
dollars a day.</p>

<p>Of course these wrecks would not be worth
anything like that now, if they were raised and
floated. Much of the cargo would be so damaged
by its long immersion in salt water that it
would be absolutely valueless, but there are
many kinds of merchandise that are not injured
in the least by water. Every ship carries a certain
amount of gold and silver; and then the
ship's hull itself is well worth salving, provided
it was not too badly damaged by the torpedo
that sank it. Altogether, there is plenty of rich
treasure in the sea awaiting the salvor who is
bold enough to go after it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
To be sure, not all of the U-boat's victims
were sunk in deep water. Many torpedoed vessels
were beached or succeeded in reaching shallow
water before they foundered. Some were
sunk in harbors while they lay at anchor, before
the precaution was taken of protecting the harbors
with nets. The Allies did not wait for the
war to end before trying to refloat these vessels.
In fact, during the war several hundred ships
were raised and put back into service. A
special form of patch was invented to close
holes torn by torpedoes. Electric pumps were
built which would work under water and these
were lowered into the holds of ships to pump
them out. The salvors were provided with
special gas-masks to protect them from poisonous
fumes of decayed matter in the wrecks.</p>

<p>Our own navy has played an important part
in salvage. Shortly after we entered the war,
all the wrecking-equipment in this country was
commandeered by the government and we sent
over to the other side experienced American salvors,
provided with complete equipment of apparatus
and machinery.</p>

<p>The majority of wrecks, however, are found
in the open sea, where it would have been foolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
to attempt any salvage-operations because of the
menace of submarine attack. On at least one
occasion a salvage vessel, while attempting to
raise the victims of a submarine, fell, itself, a
prey to a Hun torpedo. Now that this menace
has been removed, such vessels as lie in comparatively
shallow water, and in positions not
subject to sudden tempests, can be raised by the
ordinary methods; or if it is impracticable to
raise them, much of their cargo can be reclaimed.
However, most of the torpedoed ships lie at
such depths that their salvage would ordinarily
be despaired of.</p>

<h3>IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA</h3>

<p>It will be interesting to look into conditions
that exist in deep water. Somehow the notion
has gone forth that a ship will not surely sink
to the very bottom of the deep sea, but on reaching
a certain level will find the water so dense
that even solid iron will float, as if in a sea of
mercury, and that here the ship will be maintained
in suspension, to be carried hither and
yon by every chance current. Indeed, it makes
a rather fantastic picture to think of these lost
ships drifting in endless procession, far down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
beneath the cold green waves, and destined to
roam forever like doomed spirits in a circle of
Dante's Inferno.</p>

<p>But the laws of physics shatter any such illusion
and bid us paint a very different picture.
Liquids are almost incompressible. The difference
in density between the water at the surface
of the sea and that at a depth of a mile is almost
insignificant. As a matter of fact, at that depth
the water would support only about half a
pound more per cubic foot than at the surface.
The pressure, however, would be enormous.
Take the <i>Titanic</i>, for instance, which lies on the
bed of the ocean in water two miles deep. It
must endure a pressure of about two long tons
on every square inch of its surface. Long before
the vessel reached the bottom her hull
must have been crushed in. Every stick of
wood, every compressible part of her structure
and of her cargo, must have been staved in or
flattened. As a ship sinks it is not the water but
the ship that grows progressively denser. The
<i>Titanic</i> must have actually gained in weight as
she went down, and so she must have gathered
speed as she sank.</p>

<p>We may be certain, therefore, that every victim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
of Germany's ruthless U-boats that sank
in deep water lies prone upon the floor of the
sea. It matters not how or where it was sunk,
whether it was staggered by the unexpected blow
of the torpedo and then plunged headlong into
the depths of the sea, or whether it lingered,
mortally wounded, on the surface, quietly
settling down until the waves closed over it.
Theoretically, of course, a perfect balance might
be reached which would keep a submerged vessel
in suspension, but practically such a condition
is next to impossible. Once a ship has
started down, she will keep on until she reaches
the very bottom, whether it be ten fathoms or
ten hundred.</p>

<h3>A SUBMARINE GRAVEYARD</h3>

<p>Instead of the line of wandering specters,
then, we must conjure up a different picture,
equally weird&mdash;an under-world shrouded in
darkness; for little light penetrates the deep
sea. Here in the cold blackness, on the bed of
the ocean, the wrecks of vessels that once sailed
proudly overhead lie still and deathly silent&mdash;some
keeled over on their sides, some turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
turtle, and most of them probably on even keel.
Here and there may be one with its nose buried
deep in the mud; and in the shallower waters
we may come across one pinned down by the
stern, but with its head buoyed by a pocket of
air, straining upward and swaying slightly with
every gentle movement of the sea, as if still
alive.</p>

<p>This submarine graveyard offers wonderful
opportunities for the engineer, because the raising
of wrecked vessels is really a branch of engineering.
It is a very special branch, to be
sure, and one that has not begun to receive the
highly concentrated study that have such other
branches as tunneling, bridge-construction, etc.
Nevertheless it is engineering, and it has been
said of the engineer that his abilities are limited
only by the funds at his disposal. Now he has
a chance to show what he can do, for there are
hundreds of vessels to be salved where before
there was but one. The vast number of wrecks
in deep water will make it pay to do the work
on a larger and grander scale than has been
possible heretofore. Special apparatus that
could not be built economically for a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
wreck may be constructed with profit if a number
of vessels demanding similar treatment are
to be salved.</p>

<p>The principal fields of German activities were
the Mediterranean Sea and the waters surrounding
the British Isles. Although the submarine
zone covered some very deep water, where the
sounding-lead runs down two miles without
touching bottom, obviously more havoc could
be wrought near ports where vessels were
obliged to follow a prescribed course, and so
most of the U-boat victims were stricken when
almost in sight of land. In fact, as was pointed
out in a previous chapter, it was not until efficient
patrol measures made it uncomfortable
for the submarines that they pushed out into the
open ocean to pursue their nefarious work.
The <i>Lusitania</i> went down only eight miles from
Old Head of Kinsale, in fifty fathoms of water.</p>

<p>If we draw a line from Fastnet Rock to the
Scilly Islands and from there to the westernmost
extremity of France, we enclose an area
in which the German submarines were particularly
active. The soundings here run up to
about sixty fathoms in some places, but the prevailing
depth is less than fifty fathoms. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
the North Sea, too, except for a comparatively
narrow lane along the Norwegian coast&mdash;which,
by the way, marked the safety lane of the German
blockade zone&mdash;the chart shows fifty
fathoms or under. If our salvors could reach
down as far as that, most of the submarine
victims could be reclaimed. But fifty fathoms
means 300 feet, which is a formidable depth
for salvage work. Only one vessel has ever
been brought up from such a depth and that
was a small craft, one of our submarines, the
<i>F-4</i>, which sank off the coast of Hawaii four
years ago.</p>

<h3>DIFFERENT WAYS OF SALVING A WRECK</h3>

<p>There are four well-known methods of raising
a vessel that is completely submerged. Of
course, if the ship is not completely submerged,
the holes in her hull may be patched up, and
then when her hull is pumped out, the sea itself
will raise the ship, unless it be deeply embedded
in sand or mud. If the vessel is completely
submerged, the same process may be resorted
to, but first the sides of the hull must be extended
to the surface to keep the water from
flowing in as fast as it is pumped out. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
not usual to build up the entire length of the
ship. If the deck is in good condition, it may
suffice to construct coffer-dams or walls around
several of the hatches. But building up the
sides of a ship, or constructing coffer-dams on
the ship's deck is a difficult task, at best, because
it must be done under water by divers.</p>

<p>A record for this type of salvage work was
established by the Japanese when they raised
the battle-ship <i>Mikasa</i> that lay in some eighty
feet of water. Her decks were submerged to a
depth of forty feet. It is doubtful that this
salvage work could be duplicated by any other
people of the world. The wonderful patriotism
and loyalty of the Japanese race were called
forth. It is no small task to build a large coffer-dam
strong enough to withstand the weight of
forty feet of water, or a pressure of a ton and a
quarter per square foot, even when the work is
done on the surface. Perfect discipline and organized
effort of the highest sort were required.
Labor is cheap in Japan and there was no
dearth of men for the work. Over one hundred
divers were employed. In addition to the coffer-dam
construction much repair work was necessary.
Marvelous acts of devotion and heroism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
were performed. It is rumored that in
some places it was necessary for divers to close
themselves in, cut their air supply-pipes and
seal themselves off from the slightest chance
of escape; and that there were men who actually
volunteered to sacrifice their lives in this
way for their beloved country and its young
navy. Where, indeed, outside of the Land of
the Rising Sun could we find such patriotic devotion!</p>

<p>A second salvage method consists in building
a coffer-dam not on the ship but around it,
and then pumping this out so as to expose the
ship as in a dry-dock. Such was the plan followed
out in recovering the <i>Maine</i>. Obviously,
it is a very expensive method and is used only
in exceptional cases, such as this, in which it
was necessary to make a post-mortem examination
to determine what caused the destruction
of the vessel. Neither of these methods of salvage
will serve for raising a ship sunk in deep
water.</p>

<h3>RAISING A SHIP ON AIR</h3>

<p>A salvage system that has come into prominence
within recent years consists in pumping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
air into the vessel to drive the water out, thus
making the boat light enough to float. This
scheme can be used only when the deck and
bulkheads of the boat are strongly built and
able to stand the strain of lifting the wreck,
and when the hole that sank the vessel is in or
near the bottom, so as to allow enough airspace
above it to lift the boat. The work of
the diver in this case consists of closing hatches
and bulkhead doors, repairing holes in the
upper part of the hull, and generally strengthening
the deck. It must be remembered that
a deck is built to take the strain of heavy
weights bearing down upon it. It is not built
to be pushed up from beneath, so that frequently
this method of salving is rendered impracticable
because the deck itself cannot stand the
strain.</p>

<p>A more common salvage method consists in
passing cables or chains under the wreck and
attaching them to large floats or pontoons.
The slack in the chains is taken up when the tide
is low, so that on the turn of the tide the wreck
will be lifted off the bottom. The partially
raised wreck is then towed into shallower water,
until it grounds. At the next low tide, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
slack of the chains is again taken in, and at
flood-tide the wreck is towed nearer land. The
work proceeds step by step, until the vessel is
moved inshore far enough to bring its decks
awash; when it may be patched up and pumped
out. Where the rise of the tide is not sufficient
to be of much assistance, hydraulic jacks or
other lifting-apparatus are used.</p>

<h3>SALVING THE U.&nbsp;S. SUBMARINE F-4</h3>

<p>If the salvor could always be assured of clear
weather, his troubles would be reduced a hundredfold,
but at best it takes a long time to
perform any work dependent upon divers, and
the chances are very good when they are operating
in an unsheltered spot, that a storm may
come up at any time and undo the result of
weeks and months of labor. This is what
happened when the submarine <i>F-4</i> was salved.
After a month of trying effort the submarine
was caught in slings hung from barges, lifted
two hundred and twenty-five feet, and dragged
within a short distance of the channel entrance
of the harbor, where the water was but fifty
feet deep. But just then a violent storm arose,
which made the barges surge back and forth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
plunge so violently that the forward sling cut
into the plating of the submarine and crushed
it. The wreck had to be lowered to the bottom
and the barges cut free to save them from being
smashed. At the next attempt to raise the <i>F-4</i>
pontoons were again used, but instead of being
arranged to float on the surface, they were
hauled down to the wreck and made fast directly
to the hull of the submarine. Then when the
water was forced out of the pontoons with compressed
air, they came up to the surface, bringing
the submarine with them. In this way all
danger of damage due to sudden storms was
avoided because water under the surface is not
disturbed by storms overhead; and when the
wreck was floated, the pontoons and submarine
formed a compact unit.</p>

<p>While this method of salvage seems like a
very logical one for work in the open sea, one
is apt to forget how large the pontoons must
be to lift a vessel of any appreciable size. Not
only must they support their own dead weight,
together with that of the sunken vessel, but
some allowance must usually be made for dragging
the wreck out of the clutches of a sandy or
muddy bottom. Imagine the work of building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
pontoons large enough to raise the <i>Lusitania</i>.
They would have to have a combined displacement
greater than that of the vessel itself, and
they would have to be so large that they would
be very unwieldy things to handle in a seaway.
It is for this reason that submarine pontoons
are not often used to take the entire weight of
the vessel. So far they have been employed
mainly to salve small ships and then only to take
a portion of the weight, the principal work being
done by large wrecking-cranes. Instead
of horizontal pontoons it has been suggested that
vertical pontoons be employed, so as to provide
a greater lifting-power without involving the
use of enormous unwieldy units.</p>

<p>Ships are not built so that they can be picked
up by the ends. Such treatment would be liable
to break their backs in the middle. Were
they built more like a bridge truss, the salvor's
difficulties would be materially lessened. It
would be a much simpler matter to raise a vessel
with pontoons were it so constructed that
the chains of the pontoon could be attached to
each end of the hull. But because a ship is
built to be supported by the water uniformly
throughout its length, the salvor must use a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
large number of chains, properly spaced along
the hull, so as to distribute the load uniformly
and see that too much weight does not fall on
this or that pontoon.</p>

<p>The main problem, however, is to get hold of
the wreck and this requires the services of
divers, so that if there were no other limiting
factor, the depth to which a diver may penetrate
and perform his duties sets the mark beyond
which salvage as now conducted is impossible.</p>

  <div class="caption0">The Diving Sphere built for Deep Sea Salvage Operations</div>
</div>

<p>A common diver's suit does not protect the
diver from hydraulic pressure. Only a flexible
suit and a thin layer of air separates him from
the surrounding water. This air must necessarily
be of the same pressure as the surrounding
water. The air that is pumped down
to the diver not only serves to supply his
lungs, but by entering his blood transmits its
pressure to every part of his anatomy. As
long as the external pressure is equalized by
a corresponding pressure within him, the diver
experiences no serious discomfort. In fact,
when the pressure is not excessively high he
finds it rather exhilarating to work under such
conditions; for, with every breath, he takes
in an abnormal amount of oxygen. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
he returns to the surface he realizes that
he has been working under forced draft. He
is very much exhausted and he is very hungry.
It takes a comparatively short time to build
up the high internal pressure, which the diver
must have in order to withstand the pressure of
the water outside, but it is the decompression
when he returns to the surface that is attended
with great discomfort and positive danger. If
the decompression is not properly effected, the
diver will suffer agonies and even death from
the so-called "Caisson Disease."</p>

<h3>A HUMAN SODA-WATER BOTTLE</h3>

<p>We know now a great deal more than we
used to know about the effect of compressed
air on the human system, and because of this
knowledge divers have recently descended to
depths undreamed of a few years ago. When
a diver breathes compressed air, the oxygen is
largely consumed and exhaled from the lungs
in the form of carbon-dioxide, but much of the
nitrogen is dissolved in the blood and does not
escape. However, like a bottle of soda-water,
the blood shows no sign of the presence of the
gas as long as the pressure is maintained. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
on a sudden removal of the pressure, the blood
turns into a froth of nitrogen bubbles, just as
the soda-water froths when the stopper of the
bottle is removed. This froth interrupts the
circulation. The release of pressure is felt
first in the arteries and large veins. It takes
some time to reach all the tiny veins, and serious
differences of pressure are apt to occur that
often result in the rupture of blood-vessels.
The griping pains that accompany the
"Caisson Disease" are excruciating. The only
cure is to restore the blood to its original pressure
by placing the patient in a hospital lock,
or boiler-like affair, where compressed air may
be admitted; and then to decompress the air
very slowly.</p>

<p>It is possible to relieve the pressure in a
bottle of soda-water so gradually that the gas
will pass off without the formation of visible
bubbles, and that is what is sought in decompressing
a diver. After careful research it has
been found that the pressure may be cut down
very quickly to half or even less of the original
amount, but then the diver must wait for the
decompression to extend to the innermost recesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
of his being and to all the tiny capillaries
of his venous system.</p>

<p>In the salvage of the <i>F-4</i> a diver went down
306 feet, and remained on the bottom half an
hour. The pressure upon him was 135 pounds
per square inch, or about 145 tons on the surface
of his entire body. Some idea of what this
means may be gained if we consider that the
tallest office building in the world does not bear
on its foundations with a greater weight than
215 pounds to the square inch or only about 50
per cent more than the crushing pressure this
diver had to endure.</p>

<p>It took the diver a very short time to go down.
On coming up he proceeded comparatively
rapidly until he reached a depth of 100 feet.
There he found the bottom rung of a rope
ladder. On it he was obliged to rest for several
minutes before proceeding to the next rung.
The rungs of this ladder were 10 feet apart, and
on each rung the diver had to rest a certain
length of time, according to a schedule that had
been carefully worked out. At the top rung,
for instance, only 10 feet from the surface, he
was obliged to wait forty minutes. In all, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
took him an hour and forty-five minutes to come
up to the surface. The decompression was
complete and he suffered no symptoms of the
"Caisson Disease." But he was so exhausted
from his efforts that he was unfit for work for
several days. Yet the operations that he performed
at the depth of 300 feet would not have
taken more than a few minutes on the surface.</p>

<h3>A SUBMARINE REST-CHAMBER</h3>

<p>The Germans have paid a great deal of attention
to deep-diving operations, and no doubt
while their U-boats were sinking merchant ships
German salvors were anticipating rich harvests
after hostilities ended. One scheme they
developed was a submarine rest-chamber which
could be permanently located on the bottom of
the sea close to the point where the salvage
operations were to take place. This chamber
consists of a large steel box which is supplied
with air from the surface and in which divers
may make themselves comfortable when they
need a rest after arduous work. Entrance to
the chamber is effected through a door in the
floor. The pressure of the air inside prevents
the water from rising into the chamber and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
flooding it. From this submarine base the
divers may go out to the wreck, either equipped
with the ordinary air-tube helmets or with self-regenerating
apparatus which makes them independent
of an air-supply for a considerable
period of time. When the diver has worked for
an hour or two, or when he is tired, he may return
to this chamber, remove his helmet, eat a
hearty meal, take a nap if he needs it, and then
return to the salvage work without going
through the exhausting operation of decompressing.</p>

<h3>CUTTING METAL UNDER WATER WITH
A TORCH</h3>

<p>The work of the diver usually consists of far
more than merely passing lines under a sunken
hull. It is constantly necessary for him to cut
away obstructing parts. He must sometimes
use blasting-power. Pneumatic cutting-tools
frequently come into play, but the Germans have
lately devised an oxy-hydrogen torch for underwater
use, with which the diver can cut metal
by burning through it. This is accomplished
by using a cup-shaped nozzle through which a
blast of air is projected under such pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
that it blows away the water over the part to be
cut. The oxygen and hydrogen jets are then
ignited electrically, and the work of cutting the
metal proceeds in the hole in the water made by
the air-blast. A similar submarine torch has
recently been developed by an American salvage
company. It was employed successfully in
cutting drainage-holes in the bulkheads of the
<i>St. Paul</i>, which was raised in New York Harbor
in the summer of 1918.</p>

<h3>EXPLORING THE SEA BOTTOM IN A DIVER'S SLED</h3>

<p>The diver's sled is still another interesting
German invention. It is a sled provided with
vertical and horizontal rudders, which is towed
by means of a motor-boat at the surface. The
diver, seated on the sled, and provided with a
self-contained diving-suit, can direct the motor-boat
by telephone and steer his sled up and
down and wherever he chooses. And so without
any physical exertion, he can explore the
bottom of the sea and hunt for wrecks.</p>

<h3>ARMORED DIVING-SUITS</h3>

<p>From time to time attempts have been made
to construct a diver's suit that will not yield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
to the pressure of the sea, so that the diver will
not be subjected to the weight of the water
about him, but can breathe air at ordinary
atmospheric pressure. Curious armor of steel
has been devised, with articulated arms and
legs, in which the diver is completely encased.
With the ordinary rubber suit, the diver usually
has his hands bare, because he is almost as dependent
upon the sense of touch as a blind man.
But where the pressure mounts up to such a
high degree that a metal suit must be used, no
part of the body may be exposed. If a bare
hand were extended out of the protecting armor
it would immediately be mashed into a pulp and
forced back through the opening in the arms of
the suit. The best that can be done, then, is
to furnish the arms of the suit with hooks or
tongs or other mechanical substitutes for hands
which will enable the diver to make fast to the
wreck or various parts of it.</p>

<p>But if a diver feels helpless in the bag of a
suit now commonly worn, what would he do
when encased in a steel boiler; for that is
virtually what the armored suit is! A common
mistake that inventors of armor units have
made is to fail to consider the effects of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
enormous hydraulic pressure on the joints of
the suit. In order to make them perfectly tight,
packings must be employed, and these are liable
to be so jammed by the hydraulic pressure that
it is well nigh impossible to articulate the limbs.
Again, the construction of the suit should be
such that when a limb is flexed it would not displace
any more water than when in an extended
position, and vice versa. A diver may find that
he cannot bend his arm, because in doing so he
would expand the cubical content of his armor
by a few cubic inches, and to make room for this
increment of volume it would be necessary for
him to lift several hundred pounds of water.
The hydraulic pressure will reduce the steel suit
to its smallest possible dimensions, which may
result either in doubling up the members or extending
them rigidly.</p>

<p>But these difficulties are not insuperable.
There is no reason why a steel manikin cannot
be constructed with a man inside to direct its
movements.</p>

<h3>THE SALVOR'S SUBMARINE</h3>

<p>Other schemes have been devised to relieve
the diver of abnormally high air-pressure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
One plan is to construct a large spherical working-chamber
strong enough to withstand any
hydraulic pressure that might be encountered.
This working-chamber is equipped with heavy
glass ports through which the workers can observe
their surroundings in the light of an
electric search-light controlled from within the
chamber. The sphere is to be lowered to the
wreck from a barge, with which it will be in telephonic
communication and from which it will be
supplied with electric current to operate various
electrically driven mechanisms. By means of
electromagnets this sphere may be made fast to
the steel hull of the vessel and thereupon an
electric drill is operated to bore a hole in the
ship and insert the hook of a hoisting-chain.
This done, the sphere would be moved to another
position, as directed by telephone and another
chain made fast. The hoisting-chains are
secured to sunken pontoons and after enough
of the chains have been attached to the wreck
the pontoons are pumped out and the wreck is
raised.</p>

<p>It is a pity that ship-builders have not had
the forethought to provide substantial shackles
at frequent intervals firmly secured to the framing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
A sunken vessel is really a very difficult
object to make fast to and the Patent Office
has recorded many very fantastic schemes for
getting hold of a ship's hull without the use of
divers. One man proposes the use of a gigantic
pair of ice-tongs; and there have been no end
of suggestions that lifting-magnets be employed,
but no one who has any idea of how
large and how heavy such magnets must be
would give these suggestions any serious consideration.</p>

<p>But, after all, the chief obstacle to salvage in
the open sea is the danger of storms; months of
preparation and thousands of dollars' worth of
equipment may be wiped out in a moment.</p>

<h3>FIGHTING THE WAVES WITH AIR</h3>

<p>However, there has been another recent development
which may have a very important
bearing on this problem of deep-sea salvage
work. It has often been observed that a submerged
reef, twenty or thirty feet below the
surface, may act as a breakwater to stop the
storming waves. An inventor who studied this
phenomenon arrived at the theory that the
reefs set up eddies in the water which break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
up the rhythm of the waves and convert them
into a smother of foam just above the reef.
Thereupon he conceived the idea of performing
the same work by means of compressed air. He
laid a pipe on the sea bottom, forty or fifty
feet below the surface, and pumped air through
it. Just as he had expected, the line of air
bubbles produced exactly the same effect as the
submerged reef. They set up a vertical current
of water which broke up the waves as soon as
they struck this barrier of air.</p>

<p>The "pneumatic breakwater," as it is called,
has been tried out on an exposed part of the
California coast, to protect a long pier used by
an oil company. It has proved so satisfactory
that the same company has now constructed a
second breakwater about another pier near by.
There is no reason why a breakwater of this
sort should not be made about a wreck to protect
the workers from storms. Where the water is
very deep, it would not be necessary to lay the
compressed-air pipe on the bottom, but it could
be carried by buoys at a convenient depth.</p>

<p>Summing up the situation, then, there are
two serious bars to the successful salvage of
ships sunk in the open sea&mdash;the wild fury of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
waves on the surface; and the silent, remorseless
pressure of the deep. The former is the
more to be feared; and if the waves really can
be calmed, considerably more than half the
problem is solved. As for the pressure of the
sea, it can be overcome, as we have seen, either
by the use of special submarine mechanisms,
or of man-operated manikins or even of unarmored
divers. We have reached a very interesting
stage in the science of salvage, with
the promise of important developments. Fifty
fathoms no longer seems a hopeless depth.</p>

<p>Even in times of peace the sea exacts a dreadful
toll of lives and property. Before the war
the annual loss by shipwreck around the British
Isles alone was estimated at forty-five million
dollars. But the war, although it was frightfully
destructive to shipping, may in the long
run save more vessels than it sank; for it has
given us sound-detectors which should remove
the danger of collisions in foggy weather, and
the wireless compass, which should keep ships
from running off the course and on the rocks.
And now, if salvage engineering develops as it
should, the sea will be made to give up not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
much of the wealth it swallowed during the war,
but also many of the rich cargoes of gold and
silver it has been hoarding since the days of the
Spanish galleon.</p>
